In one aspect of the present invention, A is preferably a single bond, or an alkylene group. 

The moncyclic group containing ---O-C(=O)---0-, represented by Z is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which nA=2 to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a), and preferably a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring (nA=2 or 3), and more preferably

The polar group which may be possessed by the repeating unit having a polar group may be a carbonate group such as a cyclic carbonate ester structure, and the resin (A) preferably contain a repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure. 

15 a 5-membered ring (nA=2). 

The polycyclic group containing -O----C(=O)-Orepresented by Z may, for example, be a structure in which a cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure or 2 or more other ring structure 2 or more other ring structure or more other ring structure more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclid hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic ring. 

20 mula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure or 2 or more other ring structure 2 or more other ring structure or more other ring structure more other ring structure 

The repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure is preferably the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1).

The monomer corresponding to the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be synthesized by a conventionally known method described in, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 32 p. 3741(1986), Organic Letters, Vol. 4, No. 15 p. 2561(2002), and the like. 

In Formula (A-1 ), _RA_[1 ] represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group. 

If n is 2 or more, _RA_[2] 's each independently represents a substituent. 

40 

In the resin (A), the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be contained either alone or in a combination of two or more thereof. 

A represents a single bond or a divalent linking group. Z represents a atomic group forming a monocyclid or polycyclic structure together with a group represented by -O----C(=O)-O- in the formula.

Hereinafter, specific examples of the repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto. 

n represents an integer of 0 or more. 

Formula (A-1) will be described in detail. 

The alkyl group represented by _RA_[1 ] may have a substituent such as a fluorine atom. _RA_[1 ] represents preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluormethyl group, and more preferably a methyl group. 

In addition, _RA_[1 ] in the following specific examples has the 

50 same meaning as RA[1 ] in Formula (A-1). 

The substituent represented by _RA_[2 ] is, for example, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxycarbonylamino group. The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, a straight alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group and a butyl group; and a branched alkyl group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and at-butyl group. An alkyl group An alkyl group alkyl group may have a substituent such as a hydroxyl group. 

The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 55 

group, an isobutyl group and at-butyl group. An alkyl group An alkyl group alkyl group 60 

n represents the number of substituents, and is an integer of 0 or more. For example, n is preferably Oto 4, and more preferably 0. 

Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by 65 A may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond,
