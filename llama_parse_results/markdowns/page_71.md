By right-clicking and selecting **Properties**, you see detailed technical parameters, such as ID, state (online or offline), drive capacity, and the drive use, as shown in Figure 5-30.

[Figure 5-30 shows a GUI interface with two main components marked with numbered circles (1) and (2). On the left is a "Rear View" panel showing a Node Canister with iSCSI Port and USB Port options. A right-click context menu is displayed with options including "Rename", "Fix", "Turn Identify On", "Power Off Canister", "Remove", "Dependent Volumes", and "Properties" (highlighted with "right-click" label and red arrow). On the right is a "Properties for Canister 1" dialog box (marked with circle 2) showing the following information:

Canister: Canister 1

In an environment with multiple IBM Storwize V7000 clusters, you can easily direct the onsite personnel or technician to the correct device by enabling the identification LED on the front pane. Click **Turn Identify On** in the menu that is shown in Figure 5-31.

[Figure 5-31 shows two "Front View" panels side by side with a red arrow pointing from left to right. The left panel shows a front view of drive bays with one bay highlighted in blue, and a context menu displaying "Turn Identify On", "Fix", "Dependent Volumes", and "Properties" options. Below is labeled "Drive" and "Rear View". The right panel shows the same front view with one drive bay highlighted in yellow/orange, indicating the LED is turned on. Below is labeled "Drive".]

Wait for confirmation from the technician that the device in the data center was correctly identified. In the GUI, you see a flashing light, which indicates that the Identify LED was turned on.
