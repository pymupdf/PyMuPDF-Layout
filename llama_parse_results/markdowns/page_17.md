[Two side-by-side graphs showing treatment response functions. Left graph labeled "Concave Treatment Response Function" shows a concave curve with "Potential Outcome Y" on y-axis and "Treatment Level t" on x-axis. Right graph labeled "Convex Treatment Response Function" shows a convex curve with the same axes.]

*Concavity and convexity of the treatment response function* imply $$\text{Pr}\left(\frac{Y_{t_0} - W}{t_0 - t_W} \geq \frac{Y_1 - Y_0}{t_1 - t_0}, Y_1 \geq Y_0 \geq W\right) = 1$$

and $$\text{Pr}\left(\frac{Y_{t_0} - W}{t_0 - t_W} \geq \frac{Y_1 - Y_0}{t_1 - t_0}, Y_1 \geq Y_0 \geq W\right) = 1,$$ *respectively, where* $t_d$ *is a level of input for each treatment*

*status* $d \in \{0, 1\}$ *while* $t_W$ *is a level of input without the treatment and* $t_W < t_0 < t_1$. *Given* $W = w$,

*concavity and convexity of the treatment response function restrict the support of* $(Y_0, Y_1)$ *to the region below*

*the straight line* $Y_1 = \frac{t_1 - t_W}{t_0 - t_W}Y_0 - \frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_0 - t_W}w$ *and above the straight line* $Y_1 = Y_0$, *and to the region above two*

*straight lines* $Y_1 = \frac{t_1 - t_W}{t_0 - t_W}Y_0 - \frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_0 - t_W}w$ *and* $Y_1 = Y_0$, *respectively, as shown in Figures 1(b) and (c).*

**Example 3** *(Roy Model)* *In the Roy model, individuals self-select into treatment when their benefits from the*

*treatment are greater than nonpecuniary costs for treatment participation. The extended Roy model assumes*

*that the nonpecuniary cost is deterministic with the following selection equation:*

$$D = 1\{Y_1 - Y_0 \geq \mu_C(Z)\},$$

*where* $\mu_C(Z)$ *represents nonpecuniary costs with a vector of observables* $Z$. *Then treated* $(D = 1)$ *and*

*untreated people* $(D = 0)$ *are the observed groups satisfying support restrictions* $\{Y_1 - Y_0 \geq \mu_C(Z)\}$ *and*

$\{Y_1 - Y_0 < \mu_C(Z)\}$, *respectively.*

**Example 4** *(DTE conditional on Potential Outcomes)* *The conditional DTE for the unobservable subgroup*

*whose potential outcomes belong to a certain set* $C$ *is written as*

$$\text{Pr}\{Y_1 - Y_0 \leq \delta | (Y_0, Y_1) \in C\}.$$
