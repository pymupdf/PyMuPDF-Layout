15. Click **Finish** to end the storage migration wizard, as shown in Figure 9-14.

## Storage Migration Wizard

The data migration has begun. After it is completed use the finalize action in the Migration panel of the management GUI to remove the image-mode volume copies. Then unzone and remove the original storage system.

*Figure 9-14 Migration is started*

The end of the wizard is not the end of the migration task. You can find the progress of the migration in the Storage Migration window, as shown in Figure 9-15. The target storage pool and the progress of the volume copy synchronization is also displayed there.

| Volume Name               | Target Pool | Status | Progress | UID                              |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| controller0\_000000000... | Test Pool   | Online | 15%      | 600507680C9B80004800000000000034 |


*Figure 9-15 The ongoing Migration is listed in the Storage Migration window*

16. If you want to check the progress by using the CLI, run the **lsvdisksyncprogress** command because the process is essentially a volume copy, as shown in Figure 9-16.

```

17. When the migration completes, select all of the migrations that you want to finalize, right-click the selection, and click **Finalize**, as shown in Figure 9-17 on page 400.
