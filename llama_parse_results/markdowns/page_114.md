[0397] The content of the acid diffusion control agent in the resist composition is preferably 0.001% to 10% by mass, and more preferably 0.01% to 5% by mass with respect to the total solid content of the composition.

[0398] The acid diffusion control agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.

[0399] The ratio of the photoacid generator and the acid diffusion control agent in the resist composition, photoacid generator/acid diffusion control agent (molar ratio), is preferably 2.5 to 300. From the viewpoints of the sensitivity and the resolution, the molar ratio is preferably 2.5 or more, and from the viewpoint of suppression of reduction in the resolution as the resist pattern is thickened with aging after exposure until the heating treatment, the molar ratio is preferably 300 or less. The photoacid generator/acid diffusion control agent (molar ratio) is more preferably 5.0 to 200, and still more preferably 7.0 to 150.

[0400] Examples of the acid diffusion control agent include the compounds (amine compounds, amido group-containing compounds, urea compounds, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and the like) described in paragraphs <0140> to <0144> of JP2013-011833A.

[0401] <(E) Hydrophobic Resin>

[0402] The resist composition may include a hydrophobic resin other than the resin (A), in addition to the resin (A).

[0403] Although it is preferable that the hydrophobic resin is designed to be unevenly distributed on a surface of the resist film, it does not necessarily need to have a hydrophilic group in its molecule as different from the surfactant, and does not need to contribute to uniform mixing of polar materials and nonpolar materials.

[0404] Examples of the effect of addition of the hydrophobic resin include a control of static and dynamic contact angles of a surface of the resist film with respect to water and suppression of out gas.

[0405] The hydrophobic resin preferably has any one or more of a "fluorine atom", a "silicon atom", and a "CH₃ partial structure which is contained in a side chain moiety of a resin" from the viewpoint of uneven distribution on the film surface layer, and more preferably has two or more kinds. Incidentally, the hydrophobic resin preferably has a hydrocarbon group having 5 or more carbon atoms. These groups may be contained in the main chain of the resin or may be substituted in the side chain.

[0406] In a case where hydrophobic resin includes a fluorine atom and/or a silicon atom, the fluorine atom and/or the silicon atom in the hydrophobic resin may be included in the main chain or the side chain of the resin.

[0407] In a case where the hydrophobic resin includes a fluorine atom, as a partial structure having a fluorine atom,
