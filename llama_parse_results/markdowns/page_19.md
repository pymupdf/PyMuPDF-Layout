[The figure shows a coordinate system with Y₁ on the vertical axis and Y₀ on the horizontal axis. There are two intersecting lines: one labeled "Y₁ = Y₀" (diagonal line) and another line with equation "Y₁ + (t₁-t_W)/(t₀-t_W) Y₀ - (t₁-t₀)/(t₀-t_W) w". The intersection point is marked, and there is a yellow shaded triangular region in the upper right portion of the graph.]

The function φ can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum B_k = (-∞, b_k) with b_{k+1} ≤ b_k and b_k ∈ [-∞, ∞] for every integer k. By Theorem 1, for δ > 0, B_k^D is written as

$$B_k^D = \{y_1 \in \mathbb{R}|\exists y_0 < b_k \text{ s.t. } 0 \leq y_1 - y_0 < \delta \text{ and } (t_0 - t_W) y_1 - (t_1 - t_W) y_0 \leq -(t_1 - t_0) w\}$$
$$\cup \{y_1 \in \mathbb{R}|\exists y_0 < b_{k+1} \text{ s.t. } y_1 - y_0 \geq \delta \text{ and } (t_0 - t_W) y_1 - (t_1 - t_W) y_0 \leq -(t_1 - t_0) w\} .$$

Note that Y₁ = Y₀ + δ and Y₁ = $\frac{t_1-t_W}{t_0-t_W}$ Y₀ - $\frac{t_1-t_0}{t_0-t_W}$ w intersect at ($\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + y_{-1}, $\frac{t_1-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w). I consider the following three cases: a) b_{k+1} ≤ b_k ≤ $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w, b) b_{k+1} ≤ $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w ≤ b_k, and c) $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w ≤ b_{k+1} ≤ b_k.

[Three subfigures showing coordinate systems with Y₁ on vertical axis and Y₀ on horizontal axis. Each shows different configurations of lines, regions marked as B_k^D, and points marked as b_{k+1} and b_k. The subfigures are labeled (a), (b), and (c) respectively, showing different cases of the relationship between the bounds.]

**Case a)** b_{k+1} ≤ b_k ≤ $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w

If b_{k+1} ≤ b_k ≤ $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w, as illustrated in Figure A.5(a), for any y₀ < b_{k+1} ≤ $\frac{t_0-t_W}{t_1-t_0}$ δ + w, there exists
