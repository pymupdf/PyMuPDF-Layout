[Chemical structure: Polymer chain with CH2-CH repeating unit connected to a benzene ring with an oxygen substituent. The oxygen is connected to a sulfonyl group (O=S=O) with fluorine atoms. Below this is a complex counter-ion structure containing a central positively charged atom with three benzene rings, two of which have methoxy (OMe) substituents.]

[0318] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae (ZI), (ZII) and (ZIII):
