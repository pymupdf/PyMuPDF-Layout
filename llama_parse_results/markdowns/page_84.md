3. The Encryption Licenses window displays information about your control enclosures. Right-click the enclosure on which you want to install an encryption license. This action opens a menu with two license activation options (**Activate License Automatically** and **Activate License Manually**), as shown in Figure 12-10. Use either option to activate encryption. For more information about how to complete an automatic activation process, see 12.3.4, "Activate the license automatically" on page 614. For more information about how to complete a manual activation process, see 12.3.5, "Activate the license manually" on page 617.
