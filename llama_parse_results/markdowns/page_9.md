$$
C_M^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}

27.968 & 5667.577 & -92.263 \\

The fourth set of observational data is 12 Hubble evolution data from [21] and [22], its χ<sup>2</sup><sub>H</sub> is defined as

$$
\chi_H^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{12} \frac{[H(z_i) - H_{ob}(z_i)]^2}{\sigma_i^2}.
\tag{25}
$$

Note that redshifts of these data fall in the region z ∈ (0, 1.75).

In summary,

$$
\chi_{total}^2 = \tilde{\chi}_{sn}^2 + \chi_{cmb}^2 + \chi_{bao}^2 + \chi_H^2.
\tag{26}
$$

## IV. FITTING RESULTS

### A. Model I

At first, we divide the whole region of redshift into 4 bins (i.e., m = 3), the divided points and boundaries are (0, z<sub>1</sub>, z<sub>2</sub>, 1.8, ∞), where z<sub>1</sub> and z<sub>2</sub> are left as free parameters of the model, and 0 < z<sub>1</sub> < z<sub>2</sub> < 1.8. In the fourth bin we set w<sub>L</sub> = −1. It means that we divide the region with z ∈ (0, 1.8) into 3 bins and seek for two possible turning points of w<sub>de</sub>(z) in this region. The reconstructed w<sub>de</sub> of the best-fitted model is shown in Fig. 1,
