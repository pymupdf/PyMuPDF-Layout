Now choose any cell in this table and choose Pivot Table wizard in the Data menu. Excel asks for the data source and suggests this table. Click OK.

[Screenshot showing Excel interface with Insert tab ribbon displaying PivotTable, Table, Picture, Clip Art, and Shapes options. An "Insert PivotTable" dialog box is open with text explaining "Click here to summarize data using a PivotTable or to insert a PivotChart. PivotTables make it easy to arrange and summarize complicated data and drill down on details." Adjacent to this is a spreadsheet showing columns for "Name of Worker", "Week", "Nature of Payment", and "Amount" with entries for "Washing Allowance" and "Conveyance Expenses". A "Create PivotTable" dialog box is displayed showing options to "Select a table or range" with Table Range "Sheet1!$A$2:$D$50" and "Use an external data source", along with options to choose where the PivotTable report should be placed with "New Worksheet" and "Existing Worksheet" radio buttons.]

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than A1:D50, you may want to specify $A$1:$D$500.

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.

Below is "Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be placed" section with "New Worksheet" and "Existing Worksheet" radio buttons, with a Location field. The "New Worksheet" and "Existing Worksheet" options are highlighted with a red border. OK and Cancel buttons are at the bottom.]
