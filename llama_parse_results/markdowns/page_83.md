The content of the welcome message is helpful when you need to notify users about some important information about the system, such as security warnings or a location description. To define and enable the welcome message by using the GUI, edit the text area with the message content and click Save (see Figure 5-80).

The login configuration interface shows a Login section with General settings. Under "Login Message", there is explanatory text stating "The login message will be displayed to anyone logging into the GUI or in a CLI session." Below this is a checkbox labeled "Login message:" with "Enabled" checked, and a text area containing "This is an ITSO-managed system. Unauthorized access is restricted." The interface has Save and Reset buttons in the top right.

The resulting log-in screen is shown in Figure 5-81.

The login screen displays "Storwize V7000" as the main heading with "Storage Management (ITSO_V7000G2_A)" as a subtitle. Below are input fields for Username and Password, followed by a "Sign In" button. At the bottom of the login form, highlighted with a red border, is the message "This is an ITSO-managed system. Unauthorized access is restricted."

The banner message also appears in the CLI login prompt window, as shown in Figure 5-82.

The CLI window shows a PuTTY terminal session connecting to "10.18.228.64". The prompt shows "login as: ITSO_admin" followed by the banner message "This is an ITSO-managed system. Unauthorized access is restricted. Using keyboard-interactive authentication." and a "Password:" prompt.
