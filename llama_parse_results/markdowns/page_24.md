## A

[Line graph showing probability density distributions with four overlapping bell curves in different colors (blue, orange, yellow, purple). The x-axis is labeled "Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed)" ranging from -1 to 3, and the y-axis is labeled "Prob. Density". A legend shows values 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0.]

## B

[Scatter plot showing the relationship between mean dynamic FC (x-axis, ranging from -1 to 3) and standard deviation of dynamic FC (y-axis, ranging from 0.1 to 0.7). The plot shows a dense cloud of black dots forming an elliptical pattern, with the highest density in the center. Both axes are labeled "Fisher-transformed".]

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

## A

[Scatter plot showing Fisher Percentiles (y-axis, 0.0 to 1.0) versus Pearson Percentiles (x-axis, 0.0 to 1.0). The plot shows a perfect linear relationship with black dots forming a diagonal line from (0,0) to (1,1), with a red line overlay. The correlation coefficient r=0.9999 is displayed in the upper left.]

## B

[Scatter plot showing Mean dynamic FC (y-axis, ranging from -2 to +2) versus Static FC (x-axis, ranging from -2 to +2). The plot shows black dots forming a strong linear relationship with a red line overlay. The correlation coefficient r=0.97 is displayed in the upper right.]

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is r ≈ 1. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
