Figure 6-4   Create Pool dialog box

<!-- image -->

Mark the Data Reduction check box to create the Data Reduction Pool. Leaving it unmarked creates a standard storage pool.

A standard storage pool that is created by using the GUI has a default extent size of 1 GB. Data Reduction Pools have a default extent size of 4 GB. The size of the extent is selected at creation time and cannot be changed later.

If you want to specify a different extent size, you can enable this option by clicking Settings → GUI Preferences → General and checking Advanced pool settings , as shown in Figure 6-5.
