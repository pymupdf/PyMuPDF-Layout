Figure A.5: A graph showing the support under a concave treatment response. The vertical axis is Y\_1 and the horizontal axis is Y\_0. Two intersecting lines are shown. The lower line is labeled Y\_1 = Y\_0. The upper line is labeled Y\_1 = (t\_1 - t\_W)/(t\_0 - t\_W) Y\_0 - (t\_1 - t\_0)/(t\_0 - t\_W) w. The region above the upper line is shaded yellow, representing the support.

The function  $\varphi$  can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum  $B_k = (-\infty, b_k)$  with  $b_{k+1} \le b_k$  and  $b_k \in [-\infty, \infty]$  for every integer  $k$ . By Theorem 1, for  $\delta > 0$ ,  $B_k^D$  is written as

$$B_k^D = \{y_1 \in \mathbb{R} | \exists y_0 < b_k \text{ s.t. } 0 \le y_1 - y_0 < \delta \text{ and } (t_0 - t_W)y_1 - (t_1 - t_W)y_0 \le -(t_1 - t_0)w\} \\ \cup \{y_1 \in \mathbb{R} | \exists y_0 < b_{k+1} \text{ s.t. } y_1 - y_0 \ge \delta \text{ and } (t_0 - t_W)y_1 - (t_1 - t_W)y_0 \le -(t_1 - t_0)w\}.$$

Note that  $Y_1 = Y_0 + \delta$  and  $Y_1 = \frac{t_1 - t_W}{t_0 - t_W} Y_0 - \frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_0 - t_W} w$  intersect at  $\left(\frac{t_0 - t_W}{t_1 - t_0} \delta + y_{-1}, \frac{t_1 - t_W}{t_1 - t_0} \delta + w\right)$ . I consider the following three cases: a)  $b_{k+1} \le b_k \le \frac{t_0 - t_W}{t_1 - t_0} \delta + w$ , b)  $b_{k+1} \le \frac{t_0 - t_W}{t_1 - t_0} \delta + w \le b_k$ , and c)  $\frac{t_0 - t_W}{t_1 - t_0} \delta + w \le b_{k+1} \le b_k$ .
