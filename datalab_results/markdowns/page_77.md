Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than A1:D50, you may want to specify \$A\$1:\$D\$500.

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.
