# Nueva Esperanza Project

Chile

## Summary

The Nueva Esperanza Project is 100% owned by Kingsgate since February 2012. Nueva Esperanza is located in the Maricunga Gold Belt near Copiapó, a regional mining centre in Northern Chile. The silver-rich mineralisation is hosted by the Esperanza high-sulphidation epithermal alteration system associated with the Cerros Bravos volcanic complex.

The project consists of three well-defined mineralised deposits and a number of undeveloped exploration targets. The main deposits are Arqueros, Chimeros and Teterita. Arqueros was previously mined on a limited scale by underground methods and Chimeros was exploited as an open pit mine, delivering about 40 million ounces of silver in 1998/99. All three deposits currently have a combined Mineral Resources of about 93 million ounces of silver equivalent or 1.6 million ounces of gold equivalent (EQ60)<sup>1</sup>.

A feasibility study for a decision to mine the Arqueros portion of Nueva Esperanza was completed in late 2012, demonstrating that open pit mining at two million tonnes per year and processing by milling and agitation leaching in cyanide was technically feasible. Work remained to integrate the Teterita and Chimeros deposits into the project, as well as to test lower cost options for processing. Continued metallurgical testwork has shown that mineralisation from all three deposits by heap leaching is technically and economically feasible and the preferred alternative for development.

Environmental approvals to commence construction and mining at Nueva Esperanza were granted in July 2013 for the original Arqueros project. Work is underway to modify and update the environmental assessment to incorporate the heap leach process.

<sup>1</sup> Equivalence is based on gold/silver price ratio of 60. Gold equivalence = gold content plus (silver content divided by 60), whereas Silver equivalent silver content plus (gold content multiplied by 60).
