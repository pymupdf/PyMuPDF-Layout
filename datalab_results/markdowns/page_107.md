through responsive pricing, while the Grocery Products segment suffers because raw material costs are higher and price adjustments are infrequent. When protein markets weaken, the Grocery Products segment becomes more profitable, while the protein business margins soften. In the end, this balance within our business model helped deliver record profitability in fiscal 2004.

We continue to look for ways to reduce our commodity exposure. We have aggressively converted our hog contracts from a grain-based to a meat-value formula.
