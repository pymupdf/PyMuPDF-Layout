# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be indicated only once within the identification box. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio aids.

Components labeled include: Crosshatch indicates Shutdown status, Operates less than continuous or on-request, NDB Frequency, Frequency, Channel, Operational note, FSS Radio Frequencies, ASOS/AWOS, Name, Morse Code, and Identifier.](2583a26b85126a2fd60062a7e7ec4ed0_img.jpg)

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

An open circle is shown near the airport icon, indicating the NAVAID location on the airport. The text below the symbol reads: Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport.

An open circle is shown near the airport icon, indicating the NAVAID location on the airport. The text below the symbol reads: Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport. Type of NAVAID shown in top of box.

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or "DME" (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

# AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section).  
Public use airports:

- Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069' or some multiple runways less than 8069'
- Hard-surfaced runways 1500' to 8069'
- Other than hard-surfaced runways
- Seaplane bases

Military airports:

- Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation DND (Department of National Defense).

Fuel Available:

- Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.

Other airports with or without fuel:

- H
- F
- U
- R
- None
