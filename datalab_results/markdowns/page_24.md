Figure S1 consists of two panels illustrating the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients.

Panel A is a plot showing Probability Density (Y-axis) versus Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed) (X-axis). Four overlapping probability density functions (PDFs) are shown, corresponding to static functional connectivity (FC) magnitudes of 0.5 (blue), 1.0 (orange), 1.5 (yellow), and 2.0 (purple). The distributions are centered around 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, indicating that the mean dynamic FC magnitude shifts with static FC magnitude. The variances of the distributions appear similar across the range of static FC magnitudes.

Panel B is a scatter plot showing Standard Deviation of dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) (Y-axis) versus Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) (X-axis). The data points are tightly clustered around the origin (0, 0), suggesting no systematic relationship between the temporal mean and standard deviation of the Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity matrix.

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

Figure S2 compares raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients.

Panel A is a scatter plot showing Fisher Percentiles (Y-axis) versus Pearson Percentiles (X-axis). The data points form a nearly perfect straight line, indicating a strong correlation. The correlation coefficient is  $r=0.9999$ .

Panel B is a scatter plot showing Mean dynamic FC (Y-axis) versus Static FC (X-axis). The data points show a strong positive correlation, forming a tight cluster around the line of identity. The correlation coefficient is  $r=0.97$ .

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is  $r \approx 1$ . (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
