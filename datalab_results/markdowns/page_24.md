Figure S1 consists of two panels illustrating the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on dynamic fluctuations.

**Panel A:** A plot showing the probability density function (Prob. Density) of Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed) for four levels of static functional connectivity (FC): 0.5 (blue), 1.0 (orange), 1.5 (yellow), and 2.0 (purple). The distributions are centered around 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively, and show similar variances, indicating that the range of dynamic fluctuations is largely independent of the static FC magnitude.

**Panel B:** A scatter plot showing the relationship between Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) on the x-axis and St. dev. dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) on the y-axis. The data points are tightly clustered around the origin, suggesting no systematic relationship between the temporal mean and standard deviation of the Fisher-transformed dynamic FC.

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

Figure S2 compares raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients.

**Panel A:** A scatter plot showing Fisher Percentiles (Y-axis) versus Pearson Percentiles (X-axis). The data points closely follow the diagonal line (Y=X), indicating a strong correlation. The calculated correlation coefficient is  $r=0.9999$ .

**Panel B:** A scatter plot showing Mean dynamic FC (Y-axis) versus Static FC (X-axis). The data points show a strong positive correlation, indicated by the red line of best fit. The calculated correlation coefficient is  $r=0.97$ .

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is  $r \approx 1$ . (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
