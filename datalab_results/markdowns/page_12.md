Figure 5 displays five panels (A-E) illustrating partition degeneracy and correlation with excursion count.

- **A:** Node Assignments. A heatmap showing partitions identified using Louvain for a single instance of dFC (169 events). The color scale indicates Community ID (1 to 4).
- **B:** Association Matrix. A heatmap showing the association matrix for the set of 100 partitions. The color scale indicates Association weight (0 to 100).
- **C:** Z-score Rand Indices. A heatmap showing the matrix of z-score Rand indices for all pairs of the 100 partitions shown in panel A. The color scale indicates Z-score Rand index (0 to 60).
- **D:** Scatterplot. A scatterplot showing the number of events (Y-axis, 0 to 1100) plotted against the Mean Z-score Rand index (X-axis, 0 to 80) for one representative participant.
- **E:** Correlation Coefficients. A line plot showing the Mean Z-score Rand index and event count correlation plotted across 80 participants. The correlation fluctuates around zero, with only four participants exhibiting negative correlations.

Figure 5: Partition degeneracy and correlation with excursion count. (A) As an example, we show the set of 100 partitions obtained by maximizing modularity for a single instance of dFC (169 events). (B) The association matrix for this set of partitions. Each element in the association matrix counts the number of times that two nodes were assigned to the same partition. The node order is the same as in Figure 4. (C) Matrix of z-score Rand indices for all pairs of the 100 partitions shown in panel (A). (D) We show the scatterplot of mean z-score Rand index for each time point plotted against the event count, both calculated at the same time point, for one representative participant. (E) Correlation coefficients for z-score Rand index and event count plotted across participants. Note that of the 80 participants, only four exhibited negative correlations.

Figure 6 displays three panels (A-C) illustrating Default Mode Network (DMN) dissociation during mass-excursions.

- **A:** Mean Difference in Association Matrices. A heatmap showing the mean difference in association matrices constructed during non-mass excursions and excursions across all participants. The color scale ranges from -0.10 to +0.10.
- **B:** Statistically Significant Node Pairs. A heatmap showing node pairs that were statistically more or less likely to be observed in the same community during non-excursions compared to excursions. The color scale indicates the direction of change (Excursion > Non or Non > Excursion).
- **C:** Number of Significant Co-assignment Changes. A bar chart showing the number of significant co-assignment changes for nodes ordered by rank. The legend identifies network labels: CONT (Control), DMN (Default Mode Network), DAN (Dorsal Attention), LIM (Limbic), VAN (Ventral Attention), SMN (Somatomotor Network), and VIS (Visual).

Figure 6: Default mode network dissociates during mass-excursions. A) Mean difference in association matrices constructed during non-mass excursions and excursions. B) Node pairs that were statistically more or less likely to be observed in the same community during non-excursions compared to excursions. The network labels are taken from Yeo et al. (2011), with labels corresponding to networks for control (CONT), default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), limbic (LIM), ventral attention (VAN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual (VIS). C) We sum the rows of the matrix in panel B to identify regions that consistently change their community co-assignments with other regions. The regions that change the most are predominantly regions associated with DMN.
