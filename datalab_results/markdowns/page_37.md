## MCA and MTA Example at a NAVAID

MCA for aircraft traveling West along V520 to cross JAC at 15200'  
MCA for aircraft traveling West along V330 to cross JAC at 13400'

MTA for aircraft crossing over and turning at JAC:

Aircraft traveling NE on V465 and turning to V330 on a W heading or turning to V520 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 16000' or higher

Aircraft traveling E on V520 and turning to V330 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 14200'

Aircraft traveling E on V330 and turning to V520 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 16000' or higher

Aircraft traveling NW on V328 and turning to V465 on a SW heading must turn at altitude of 15100' or higher.
