[0144] As the amount of the repeating unit BN2, the lower limit is preferably 5 mol %, more preferably 10 mol % based on the whole repeating units constituting the component (B). The upper limit is preferably 70 mol %, more preferably 60 mol %.

[0145] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) preferably contains the repeating unit BN2, additionally at least one kind of a repeating unit selected from the repeating units B3 to B5 in addition to the repeating unit B1 in view of coexisting high etching durability and resolution. In this case, these repeating units are contained in an amount of 60 mol % or more, more preferably 70 mol % or more, and still more preferably 80 mol % or more in the whole repeating units. This securely gives properties demanded for the inventive negative resist composition.

[0146] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) may contain a lactone structure, a (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group such as a hydroxy group other than the phenolic hydroxy group, and other repeating units in order to fine-tune the properties of a resist film. Illustrative examples of the (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group include the units shown by the following general formulae (b1) to (b3). These units can be used supplementary as a unit to control the unit to give adhesiveness to a substrate and the solubility without showing acidity.

(b1)

Chemical structure (b1): A (meth)acrylate ester unit featuring a cyclohexene ring substituted with a hydroxyl group ( $G^1$ ).

(b2)

Chemical structure (b2): A (meth)acrylate ester unit featuring a substituted cyclohexene ring substituted with a hydroxyl group ( $G^2$ ).
