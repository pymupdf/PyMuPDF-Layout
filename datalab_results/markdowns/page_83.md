The content of the welcome message is helpful when you need to notify users about some important information about the system, such as security warnings or a location description. To define and enable the welcome message by using the GUI, edit the text area with the message content and click **Save** (see Figure 5-80).

Figure 5-80 shows the configuration screen for enabling the login message. The screen is divided into sections: Login (with General settings) and Login Message. The Login Message section contains the text: "The login message will be displayed to anyone logging into the GUI or in a CLI session." Below this, the setting "Login message:  Enabled" is shown. The message content area contains the text: "This is an ITSO-managed system. Unauthorized access is restricted." Buttons for Save and Reset are visible.
