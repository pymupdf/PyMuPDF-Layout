# WARRANTY

BARSKA warrants your microscope to be free from defects in materials and workmanship for one (1) year. BARSKA will repair or replace such product or part thereof which, upon inspection by BARSKA, is found to be defective in materials or workmanship. As a condition to the obligation of BARSKA to repair or replace such product, the product must be returned to BARSKA together with proof-of-purchase satisfactory to BARSKA.

The Proper Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA) must be obtained from BARSKA in advance of return. Call BARSKA at (909) 445-8168 to receive the number to be displayed on the outside of your shipping container.

All returns must be accompanied by a written statement setting forth the name, address, and daytime telephone number of the owner, together with a brief description of any claimed defects. Parts or product for which replacement is made shall become the property of BARSKA.

The customer shall be responsible for all costs of transportation and insurance, both to and from BARSKA, and shall be required to prepay such costs.

BARSKA shall use reasonable efforts to repair or replace any microscope covered by this warranty within thirty days of receipt. In the event repair or replacement shall require more than thirty days, BARSKA shall notify the customer accordingly. BARSKA reserves the right to replace any product which has been discontinued from its product line with a new product of comparable value and function.

This warranty shall be void and of no force of effect in the event a covered product has been modified in design or function, or subjected to abuse, misuse, mishandling or unauthorized repair. Further, product malfunction or deterioration due to normal wear is not covered by this warranty.

**BARSKA DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN. THE SOLE OBLIGATION OF BARSKA UNDER THIS LIMITED WARRANTY SHALL BE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COVERED PRODUCT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SET FORTH HEREIN. BARSKA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LOST PROFITS, GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHICH MAY RESULT FROM BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY, OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY BARSKA PRODUCT. ANY WARRANTIES WHICH ARE IMPLIED AND WHICH CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED SHALL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO A TERM OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ORIGINAL RETAIL PURCHASE.**

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or limitation on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.

This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

BARSKA reserves the right to modify or discontinue, without prior notice to you, any model or style microscope.
