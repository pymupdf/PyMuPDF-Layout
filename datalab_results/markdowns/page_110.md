# DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

[0039] Hereinafter, an example of embodiments for carrying out the present invention will be described.

[0040] In the present specification, a numerical range expressed using “to” is used in a meaning of a range that includes the preceding and succeeding numerical values of “to” as the lower limit value and the upper limit value, respectively.

[0041] Moreover, in citations for a group (atomic group) in the present specification, in a case where the group is denoted without specifying whether it is substituted or unsubstituted, the group includes both a group not containing a substituent and a group containing a substituent. For example, an “alkyl group” which is not denoted about whether it is substituted or unsubstituted includes not only an alkyl group not containing a substituent (unsubstituted alkyl group), but also an alkyl group containing a substituent (substituted alkyl group).

[0042] “(Meth)acryl” in the present specification collectively refers to acryl and methacryl, and means “at least one of acryl or methacryl”. Similarly, “(meth)acrylic acid” means “at least one of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid”.

[0043] In the present specification, the weight-average molecular weight ( $M_w$ ), the number-average molecular weight ( $M_n$ ), and the dispersity (also referred to as a molecular weight distribution) ( $M_w/M_n$ ) of a resin are defined as values in terms of polystyrene by means of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurement (solvent: tetrahydrofuran, flow amount (amount of a sample injected): 10  $\mu\text{L}$ , columns: TSK gel Multipore HXL-M manufactured by Tosoh Corporation, column temperature: 40° C., flow rate: 1.0 mL/min, detector: differential refractive index detector) using a GPC apparatus (HLC-8120 GPC manufactured by Tosoh Corporation).

[0044] 1 Å is  $1\times 10^{-10}$  m.

[0045] «Photosensitive Composition for EUV Light»

[0046] The photosensitive composition for EUV light of an embodiment of the present invention (hereinafter also referred to as a “resist composition”) satisfies Conditions 1 and 2 which will be described later. A reason why a desired effect is obtained by satisfying these conditions is shown below.

[0047] EUV light has a wavelength of 13.5 nm, which is a shorter wavelength than that of ArF (wavelength of 193 nm) light or the like, and therefore, the EUV light has a smaller number of photons upon exposure with the same sensitivity. With this, an effect of “photon shot noise” that the number of photos is statistically non-uniform is significant and deterioration in LER is caused. In order to reduce the photon shot noise, a method in which an exposure dose is increased to cause an increase in the number of incident photons is available, but the method is a trade-off with a demand for high sensitivity. Further, a method in which the thickness of a resist film is increased to cause an increase in the number of absorbed photons is also available, but it causes a reduction in a resolution.

[0048] In contrast, according to the present invention, it is found that the problem can be solved by making a pattern thus formed into a thin film while increasing an absorption efficiency of EUV light. In a case where the A value shown in Condition 1 is high, absorption of EUV light of a resist film formed with the resist composition is high, and by satisfying Condition 2, a pattern formed with the resist

composition is made into a thin film. As a result, a Z-factor which is total performance of a resolution, a line edge roughness (LER), and a sensitivity is improved, and also, generation of pattern collapse is suppressed.

[0049] The resist composition satisfies Condition 1. As described above, in a case where the A value defined in Condition 1 is high, the absorption efficiency of EUV light of the resist film formed with the resist composition is increased. The A value represents the absorption efficiency of EUV light of the resist film in terms of a mass ratio.

[0050] Condition 1: The A value determined by Formula (1) is 0.14 or more.

$$A=\frac{([H]\times 0.04+[C]\times 1.0+[N]\times 2.1+[O]\times 30.6+[F]\times 50.6+[S]\times 1.5+[I]\times 39.5)}{([H]\times 1+[C]\times 12+[N]\times 14+[O]\times 16+[F]\times 19+[S]\times 32+[I]\times 127)}$$

Formula (1):

[0051] As described, the A value is 0.14 or more, but from the viewpoint that at least one of additional improvement of the Z-factor or additional suppression of pattern collapse is achieved (hereinafter also simply referred to as “the effect of the present invention is more excellent”), the A value is preferably 0.16 or more, more preferably 0.18 or more, and particularly preferably 0.20 or more. The upper limit is not particularly limited, but in a case where the A value is extremely high, the transmittance of EUV light of the resist film is lowered, the optical profile in the resist film is deteriorated, as a result, it is difficult to obtain a good pattern shape, and therefore, the upper limit is preferably 0.24 or less, and more preferably 0.22 or less.

[0052] In a case where A is less than 0.14, the Z-factor is usually deteriorated.

[0053] Moreover, in Formula (1), [H] represents a molar ratio of hydrogen atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, [C] represents a molar ratio of carbon atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, [N] represents a molar ratio of nitrogen atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, [O] represents a molar ratio of oxygen atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, [F] represents a molar ratio of fluorine atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, [S] represents a molar ratio of sulfur atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light, and [I] represents a molar ratio of iodine atoms derived from the total solid content with respect to all the atoms of the total solid content in the photosensitive composition for EUV light.

[0054] For example, in a case where the resist composition includes a resin that has an increased polarity by the action of an acid polarity and thus, has an increased solubility in an alkali developer and a decreased solubility in an organic solvent, a photoacid generator, an acid diffusion control agent, and a solvent, the resin, the photoacid generator, and the acid diffusion control agent correspond to the solid content. That is, all the atoms in the total solid content correspond to a sum of all the atoms derived from the resin, all the atoms derived from the photoacid generator, and all the atoms derived from the acid diffusion control agent.
