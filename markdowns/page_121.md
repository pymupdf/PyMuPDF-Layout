[0317] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are described below.

(Photo-Acid Generator)

[0318] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae  $(ZI)$ ,  $(ZII)$  and  $(ZIII)$ :
