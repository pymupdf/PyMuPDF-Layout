## **3.4. Physical or virtual data rooms**

The `Terms of Reference`, **point 1.2** may provide for a **physical** or **virtual data room,** if required by the subject matter of the procurement, subject to the Tenderer's prior signature of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.

- a) Where a **physical data room** is used, it will be made available to Tenderers to facilitate access to information that is not publicly available and that Tenderers may find useful for preparing the technical and financial offer. Depending on the sensitivity of the information provided the access of attendees per Tenderer will be restricted to the number indicated in **point 1.2** of the `Terms of Reference`. The access of third parties (for example subcontractors) is prohibited. Attendees will not be permitted to take copies in any form of the data made available to them.
- b) Where a **virtual data room** is used, it will be made available upon specific request by the Tenderer to access all existing and necessary technical or confidential data that Tenderers may find useful for preparing the technical and financial offer. The virtual data room is the computerized online platform and will be accessible to the Tenderers who register online and sign the Undertaking of confidentiality and Non-disclosure. Once the Tenderer has signed such Undertaking of confidentiality and Non-disclosure and sent back to the following address [CS-procurement@eib.org](mailto:CS-procurement@eib.org) the Tenderer will be provided by return with a link and granted access to the virtual data room. The information in the virtual data room is provided to the Tenderer solely and exclusively for the purpose of preparing a Tender. The information cannot be used totally or partially, directly or indirectly, for any other purpose, unless the EIB gives its prior written authorisation. The Tenderers are not authorised to copy, print or distribute none of the documents/data/drawings or any other information from virtual data room.

## **3.5. Clarification following the submission of tenders**

Where information or documentation contained in a tender is or appears to be incomplete or erroneous or where specific documents are missing, EIB may request the Tenderer concerned to submit, supplement, clarify or complete the relevant information or documentation within an appropriate lime limit. EIB shall ensure that such requests are made in full compliance with the principles of equal treatment and transparency.

Without prejudice to the preceding paragraph, if, after the deadline for submission of tenders, a clarification is needed by EIB or if obvious clerical errors in the tender need to be corrected, EIB may contact the Tenderer concerned, although such contacts may not lead to any alterations of the terms of the submitted tender.

Only in the case of a negotiated procedure, competitive dialogue or competitive procedure with negotiation as well as in procurement procedures below the Directive threshold (as regularly updated), the EIB may negotiate with all the tenderers the offers they have submitted, in order to adapt them to the requirements set out in the contract notice, `Terms of Reference` or any additional document in order to find the tender offering best value for money. During negotiations equal treatment of all Tenderers will be ensured.

## **3.6. Presentations**

If foreseen in the 'Terms of Reference' and in accordance with the objective criteria defined therein, Tenderers having passed the exclusion and selection stage, may be invited to make an oral
