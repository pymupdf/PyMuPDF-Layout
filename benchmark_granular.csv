5,0,"Queue Prioritization Experiment We tested our method for prioritizing the crawling queue using Bengali language Twitter users. In order to properly compare the various methods we first collected a data set of 10,785 Twitter users. (5,684 users came from our search queries and an additional 5,103 came from those users' social connections.) The way the queue ranking works is to first download a small set of users and use that as training data to learn a ranking for the rest of the download queue. We randomly selected 300 users for our training set. The ranking methods were used to order the remaining 10,000+ users in the simulated download queue. In Figure 2, we show the cumulative in-vocabulary tokens obtained as an additional 500 users are processed from the download queue for each of the three prioritization strategies. The predictive ranking provides three times as many in- vocabulary tokens as either the edge count ranking or the random baseline. Figure 3 is similar but shows the cumulative vocabulary coverage (types) where the vocabulary is taken from a held-out dev set different from the text used to produce the Twitter queries. The horizontal line represents the type coverage of the in-domain training data. The predictive ranking covers an additional 10% of the dev-set vocabulary compared to either of the other strategies. More than 53% of the vocabulary types and about 9% of the tokens in the dev- set are not found in the in-domain training data. The Twitter data downloaded using the predictive ranking covers 56% of these previously unseen vocabulary types, substantially out- performing the edge count ranking and the random baseline. The match between the vocabulary of the data obtained with the predictive ranking with the in-domain data is an indication of the value of the predictive ranking strategy. The most important features for the predictive ranking (as measured by the average decrease in node impurity in the random forest regression model) are average number of reverse followers in the training set, average sentence count after filtering among followers in the training set and aver- age sentence count after filtering among mentioners in the training set. Even though edge features highly influence the predictive ranking model, the edge count ranking is worse than the predictive ranking on both of the type coverage and the cumulative IV token metrics. This is because there are high edge count connections from Bengali speaking Twitter users to international celebrities, which fools the edge count ranking strategy but not the random forest regression. (The top followed Twitter user by Bengali speakers is @BarackObama followed by @BillGates.) We created language models from the downloaded data to compare the effectiveness of the ranking strategies. The language models used the data from the 300 users in the training set as well as the additional users selected by each of the respective ranking strategies. Table VI lists the resulting perplexities on the held-out in-domain data.

Statistical determination of large scale flow As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evi- dence for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalised LCDM model [18] and therefore, it is important to confirm these results as it may indicate evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity.

We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical er- rors, due to a significant shot-noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger con- straints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk flow measurements in the literature. In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters b and vp for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation be- tween these two parameters because the anisotropic am- plitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity fields. The best fit value from Fig- ure 5 is vp = 270+433 km/s (at the 1s level marginalised with other parameters including b) and is consistent with vp = 0. We do not quote the negative bound of the error on vp as it is below zero and thus has no physical mean- ing. Instead, we quote the upper bound on vp and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of vp is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a WMAP5-normalised LCDM model. We propose above that vp is a complementary param- eter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter gTh, which is equivalent to fs8, is not de- termined precisely without the prior information of AS. But when we report our measurement with vp, there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to g*Th determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value vp at a given redshift is not only in- dependent of bias but also independent of normalisation. B. Reconstruction of matter density field from vp We convert vp measurement into gTh using As from WMAP5 (gTh: coherent growth factor of peculiar veloc- ity, and it is equivalent to fs8 in other parameteriza- tions). With the evolution of gTh known, dynamics of per- turbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ps through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z 0.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of Th into the coherent evolution of Ps. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coher- ent evolution of Ph, gPh. We are able to determine matter density fluctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coher- ent growth of dm, gd = 0.7, which is related to gPh as",0.2087329631499243," increasing eigenmodes and see a ""kink"" in the distribution which we interpret as indicating a transition in the signal-to-noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the first ten modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered modes are dominated by noise.

## A. Statistical determination of large scale flow

As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evidence for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalised ΛCDM model [18] and therefore, it is important to confirm these results as it may indicate

evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity. In this paper, we provide a first demonstration of our new parameterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In detail, we attempt to model the ""squashing"" of the 2-D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical errors, due to a significant shot-noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger constraints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk flow measurements in the literature.

In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters \( b \) and \( v_{p} \) for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation between these two parameters because the anisotropic amplitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity fields. The best fit value from Figure 5 is \( v_{p}=270^{+433} \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{s} \) (at the \( 1 \sigma \) level marginalised with other parameters including \( b \) ) and is consistent with \( v_{p}=0 \). We do not quote the negative bound of the error on \( v_{p} \) as it is below zero and thus has no physical meaning. Instead, we quote the upper bound on \( v_{p} \) and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of \( v_{p} \) is close to the predicted value of \( 203 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{s} \) for a WMAP5-normalised \( \Lambda \mathrm{CDM} \) model.

We propose above that \( v_{p} \) is a complementary parameter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter \( g_{\Theta} \), which is equivalent to \( f \sigma_{8} \), is not determined precisely without the prior information of \( A_{S} \). But when we report our measurement with \( v_{p} \), there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to \( g_{\Theta}^{*} \) determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value \( v_{p} \) at a given redshift is not only independent of bias but also independent of normalisation.

## B. Reconstruction of matter density field from \( v_{p} \)

We convert \( v_{p} \) measurement into \( g_{\Theta} \) using \( A_{s} \) from WMAP5 ( \( g_{\Theta} \): coherent growth factor of peculiar velocity, and it is equivalent to \( f \sigma_{8} \) in other parameterizations). With the evolution of \( g_{\Theta} \) known, dynamics of perturbations are reconstructed to provide the history of \( \Psi \) through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of \( v_{p} \) is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample ( \( z \simeq 0.1 \) ), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of \( \Theta \) into the coherent evolution of \( \Psi \). If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coherent evolution of \( \Phi, g_{\Phi} \).

We are able to determine matter density fluctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coherent",0.897778899545684,"FIG. 4: An ordered list of the Eigenvalues for our cluster covariance matrix.

We convert vp measurement into gΘ using As from WMAP5 (gΘ: coherent growth factor of peculiar velocity, and it is equivalent to fσ8 in other parameterizations). With the evolution of gΘ known, dynamics of perturbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ψ through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z ≃ 0.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of Θ into the coherent evolution of Ψ. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coherent evolution of Φ, gΦ. 

We are able to determine matter density fluctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coherent growth of δm, gδ = 0.7, which is related to gΦ as

This corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of the data assuming a bigram model.

The benefit of using word classes is that the resulting language model can have fewer parameters than a word-based n-gram model. In our case, the in-domain training text is so small that it can be a real advantage to have fewer parameters to learn in the language model. The problem is that if the data is too small to reliably estimate word transition probabilities  $(p(w_i|w_{i-1}))$ , then it will also be difficult to learn a good partitioning of the words into classes.

Our hypothesis is that the advantage in learning the word class assignments on the Twitter data, which solves the data sparsity problem, outweighs any performance penalty that is incurred due to domain mis-match. This differs from the traditional approach where the class assignments  $(w_i \in c_j)$  are learned from the same training text which is used to estimate the class transition probabilities  $(p(c_i|c_{i-1}))$  and the word probabilities  $(p(w_i|c_i))$ .

The in-domain data used in the experiments in this paper comes from the IARPA Babel program.<sup>1</sup> This program focuses on keyword search for low-resource languages. The languages are low resource in the sense that they have fewer native speakers than the languages receiving the most attention from researchers and also in the sense that the provided training data is small in comparison to what is typically used.

In our case, the in-domain training text is so small that it can be a real advantage to have fewer parameters to learn in the language model. The problem is that if the data is too small to reliably estimate word transition probabilities ( _p_ ( _wi|wi−_ 1)), then it will also be difficult to learn a good partitioning of the words into classes. 

Our hypothesis is that the advantage in learning the word class assignments on the Twitter data, which solves the data sparsity problem, outweighs any performance penalty that is incurred due to domain mis-match. This differs from the traditional approach where the class assignments ( _wi ∈ cj_ ) are learned from the same training text which is used to estimate the class transition probabilities ( _p_ ( _ci|ci−_ 1)) and the word probabilities ( _p_ ( _wi|cj_ )).

18,0,"For this purpose, we look at the temperature depen- dence of the rotation angle of the magnetization between NN planes. In Fig. 7, phl(T ) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1 . . . 4. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature T TN(8), an abrupt drop of ph3 and ph4, which rapidly reach an almost con- stant value, only slightly larger than ph1. In the tem- perature range TN(8) T < TC(8) we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all NN layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-FM configuration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position Qz,max of the structure factor S(0, 0, qz). In Fig. 8 the average of Qz,max vs T is reported, again for n = 8 and for different lateral dimen- sions L26. As expected from the previous argument, we see that Qz,max = 0 for TN(8) < T < TC(8), while it be- gins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below TN(8), making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with Qz,max = 0 and reaching a value of about 21*for T = 10 K. In a previous study, where the magnetic properties of Ho thin films were investigated by MC simulations of a Heisenberg model with easy-plane single-ion anisotropy and six out-of-plane coupling constants (as obtained by experimental neutron scattering measurements16) on a HCP lattice14,15, it was found that for thicknesses compa- rable with the helical pitch the phase diagram landscape is quite different from what we find here. Indeed, for n = 9 -16, three different magnetic phases could be sin- gled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layers blocks coexist with some inner dis- ordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the sig- natures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one. The absence of the block phase in the J1 -J2 model here investigated has to be attributed to the different range of interactions, rather than to the different lattice structure.

In Fig. 7, Δϕ<sub>l</sub>(T) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1 . . . 4. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature $$T \lesssim T_N(8)$$, an abrupt drop of Δϕ<sub>3</sub> and Δϕ<sub>4</sub>, which rapidly reach an almost constant value, only slightly larger than Δϕ<sub>1</sub>.

Indeed, for n = 9 − 16, three different magnetic phases could be singled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layers blocks coexist with some inner disordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the signatures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one.

## SUCCESS RATE OF 44% IN 2004

Santos’ 2004 exploration effort produced good results, as the Company high graded its exploration acreage and started drilling one of the most exciting portfolios in the industry.

Santos discovered hydrocarbons in seven of the sixteen wildcat wells that were drilled, achieving an impressive success rate of 44%.

The program added at least 93 million boe (including the pre-drill estimate for Jeruk) of recoverable resources that will be further evaluated by delineation and, in some cases, production history to determine 1P and 2P reserve additions.

98,1,"In 2004, Santos continued its normal business of actively managing its portfolio through the divestment of non-core assets and the acquisition of assets that fit well with existing Santos assets or can add to the ability of the Company to meet its strategic goals. As a result of this activity, Santos realised an after-tax profit of $47.4 million on oil and gas asset sales and will continue to high-grade its portfolio on an ongoing basis. Santos entered into an agreement with PT Medco during the first half of 2004 to acquire some of Novus Petroleum's Indonesian and Cooper Basin assets conditional on the success of PT Medco's takeover offer for Novus, which was ultimately successful. Specifically, Santos announced in September 2004 that it had executed formal agreements to acquire an additional 4.75% of the South Australian Cooper Basin, 18% of the Brantas PSC and 9% of the Kakap PSC from Medco for US$110 million. On 31 December 2004, Santos paid Medco US$98 million for the majority of the assets, with payment for the remaining 2.75% of Kakap PSC expected to be made in the first quarter of 2005.

Santos entered into an agreement with PT Medco during the first half of 2004 to acquire some of Novus Petroleum's Indonesian and Cooper Basin assets conditional on the success of PT Medco's takeover offer for Novus, which was ultimately successful.

In addition, an exploration joint venture was formed with ConocoPhillips in the NT/P61 block offshore Darwin, Northern Territory, to drill the Caldita well and provide Santos with access rights to a potential expansion of the Wickham Point LNG facility. This deal further enhances Santos' infrastructure strategy to leverage its position within vital infrastructure to improve shareholder value while reducing the risk profile of the wildcat exploration program.

Specifically, Santos announced in September 2004 that it had executed formal agreements to acquire an additional 4.75% of the South Australian Cooper Basin, 18% of the Brantas PSC and 9% of the Kakap PSC from Medco for US$110 million. On 31 December 2004, Santos paid Medco US$98 million for the majority of the assets, with payment for the remaining 2.75% of Kakap PSC expected to be made in the first quarter of 2005.

The acquisition of these Victorian gas interests strengthens Santos' domestic gas and infrastructure strategy that was further enhanced by the OMV purchase announced early in 2005. Importantly, Santos is ",0.7319767441860465,", Santos

expanded its offshore Victorian

gas interests to 50% in both the

Patricia-Baleen and the Sole gas

fields through the acquisition

from Trinity Gas Resources of an

additional 30% interest in the

Patricia-Baleen gas field and

associated processing facilities in

eastern Victoria and an additional

15% interest in the Sole gas field.


Santos earned its 30% additional

equity in the Patricia-Baleen gas

field by meeting Trinity’s

remaining share of drilling costs

on the Baleen 4 well which was

drilled successfully as a sidetrack

well of Baleen 3. Santos will earn

its 15% additional equity in the

Sole gas field by meeting certain

development costs on behalf of

Trinity, if and when the Sole joint

venture partners proceed to

develop this gas resource.



The acquisition of these Victorian

gas interests strengthens Santos’

domestic gas and infrastructure

strategy that was further

enhanced by the OMV purchase

announced early in 2005.

Importantly, Santos is now the

operator of the strategic Orbost

gas processing facility.


Late in the year, Santos sold its

18.02% share in the Carpentaria

Gas Pipeline between Ballera

and Mount Isa in Queensland

to Australian Pipeline Trust for

$59 million, resulting in a

$21 million after-tax profit

that was booked in the 2004

all Group companies periodically carry out reviews of the basic

management policies for each risk category, or whenever deemed

necessary, thus ensuring that the policies followed at any time

are the most appropriate. The management of SMFG constantly

monitors the conduct of risk management at Group companies,

providing guidance when necessary.
