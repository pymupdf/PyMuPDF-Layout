The details of centralized scheme A are presented in Algorithm 2. Centralized Scheme A: Complexity Analysis The initial allocation phase has a complexity of O(KN2) which is the same as Algorithm 1. Next, we perform a one dimensional search for the user in cell l with maximum incremental throughput at subcarrier n. The process is repeated for each subcarrier and cell. Thus, the com- rotational complexity of this step is O(Key). Since, the process continues until convergence, (i.e., M iterations), the complexity of this step can be written as O(KNLM). Finally, the total complexity of subcarrier allocation phase is O(KN2 + NKLM). The complexity of Phase In is difficult to determine, however, it can be measured in terms of the degree of difficults (Doi) that in turn relies on the number of constraints and variables associated with the Gt [15]. Since we are dealing with Lt power constraints and Log power variables, the total computational complexity of centralized scheme A is O(KN2 + NKLM) + Doi(Log).

2,1,"Novel semiconductors materials for fiend effect tran- sister For and thin-film transistors The are highly demanded.1 In particular, semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) are very promising, because individual s-SWNTs are known to exhibit high on-offcurrent ratio, high electron/hole mobil- ity, to carry high current density and to operate at high frequencies.2-5 Several groups have demonstrated excellent transfer characteristics using individual s- SWNTs,2-5 but generally poor ones using ensemble (net- work and thin film) of SWNTs due to traces of metal- lic nanotubes (m-SWNTs) and impurities (catalytic and amorphous particles).6-8 Therefore, very effievent meth- ods to selectively synthesis s-SWNTs or to selectively extract s-SWNTs from as-grown nanotubes are still re- quoted. In recent years, several approaches to extract s- SWNTs from nanotube powders were explored using for instance chemical functionalization,9-11 Div and polymers wrapping,12,13 and density gradient ultra- centrifugation techniques.6 The latter efficiently sept- rates s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs, but traces of surfactant and density gradient materials limit the performances of the For. Very recently, two groups have reported on the selective extraction of near-armchair s-SWNTs from nanotube powders using polyflmoreno as extracting agent.14,15 According to Fish et al.,14 the sample shows no detectable traces of m-SWNTs based only on optical spectroscopy. However, neither the electrical properties nor the fabrication of For devices were addressed. In this letter, we report on the electronic properties of For consisting of semiconducting-enriched single wall carbon nanotubes, without detectable traces of metallic nanotubes and impurities, with in our detection limits. This unprecedented achievement is made possible by ul- tracentrifugation (250,000g), sanitation and filocation of solutions composed of SWik powders with polyflmoreno as extracting agent in toluene.

3,0,"Random Effacts Model In the random effacts model (Table 1), automated blocking generates an MCMC algorithm identical to the Informed Blocking algorithm (blocking each ai, bi pair), which produces a twofold improve- ment in Effiagency over the most effievent static algorithm - for this model, All Scalar sampling. The cut height h = 0.1 indicates that only the ai, bi pairs exhibit posterior correlations above 0.9. The Informed Cross-Level algorithm requires a substantially longer Runtime and produces a high End, which results in nearly identical Effiagency as the efficiently blocked Auto Blocking algorithm. Auto-Aggressive Model In the auto-repressive model (Table 1), an As process value exhibited the slowest mixing under All Scalar sampling. When all 24 model parameters (As process values, fired effacts, and one hyper-parameter) are blocked, the algorithm Runtime is nearly halved.

5,0,"Queue Prioritization Experiment We tested our method for prioritizing the crawling queue using Bengali language Twitter users. In order to properly compare the various methods we first collected a data set of 10,785 Twitter users. (5,684 users came from our search queries and an additional 5,103 came from those users' social connections.) The way the queue ranking works is to first download a small set of users and use that as training data to learn a ranking for the rest of the download queue. We randomly selected 300 users for our training set. The ranking methods were used to order the remaining 10,000+ users in the simulated download queue. In Figure 2, we show the cumulative in-vocabulary tokens obtained as an additional 500 users are processed from the download queue for each of the three prioritization strategies. The predictive ranking provides three times as many in- vocabulary tokens as either the edge count ranking or the random baseline. Figure 3 is similar but shows the cumulative vocabulary coverage (types) where the vocabulary is taken from a held-out dev set different from the text used to produce the Twitter queries. The horizontal line represents the type coverage of the in-domain training data. The predictive ranking covers an additional 10% of the dev-set vocabulary compared to either of the other strategies. More than 53% of the vocabulary types and about 9% of the tokens in the dev- set are not found in the in-domain training data. The Twitter data downloaded using the predictive ranking covers 56% of these previously unseen vocabulary types, substantially out- performing the edge count ranking and the random baseline. The match between the vocabulary of the data obtained with the predictive ranking with the in-domain data is an indication of the value of the predictive ranking strategy. The most important features for the predictive ranking (as measured by the average decrease in node impunity in the random forest regression model) are average number of reverse followers in the training set, average sentence count after fistoring among followers in the training set and over- age sentence count after fistoring among pensioners in the training set. Even though edge features highly inflhence the predictive ranking model, the edge count ranking is worse than the predictive ranking on both of the type coverage and the cumulative In token metrics. This is because there are high edge count connections from Bengali speaking Twitter users to international celebrities, which fools the edge count ranking strategy but not the random forest regression. (The top followed Twitter user by Bengali speakers is @BarackObama followed by @BillGates.) We created language models from the downloaded data to compare the effectiveness of the ranking strategies. The language models used the data from the 300 users in the training set as well as the additional users selected by each of the respective ranking strategies. Table Vs lists the resulting perplexities on the held-out in-domain data. The predictive ranking Lt achieved a 17% reduction in perplexity over the random baseline after downloading 500 users from the queue.

Application to the Distribution of Effacts of Smoking on Birth Weight In this section, I apply the results presented in Section 3 to an empirical analysis of the distribution of smoking effacts on infant birth weight. Smoking not only has a direct impact on infant birth weight, but is also associated with unobservable factors that affect infant birth weight. I identify marginal distributions of potential infant birth weight with and without smoking by making use of a state cigarette tax hike in Massachusetts (MA) in January 1993 as a source of exogenous variation. I focus on pregnant women who change their smoking behavior from smoking to nonsmoking in response to the tax increase.

In doing the Sha, we select the dominant proves to con- tribute to the kh2 by requiring that l2 > 2/Nik. In Figure 4, we rank the eigenvalues (li) for the in- creating eigenmodes and see a ""link"" in the district- tion which we interpret as indicating a transition in the signal-to-noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the first ten modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered modes are dominated by noise. We therefore remove eigenmodes beyond this link (with li < 0.01) where the eigenvalues start to flalten out. Statistical determination of large scale flow As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evi- dance for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalized LCan model [18] and therefore, it is important to confirm these results as it may indicate evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity. In this pa- per, we provide a first demonstration of our new param- eterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In detail, we attempt to model the ""squashing"" of the 2- D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the De3 sample to leads to large statistical er- rows, due to a signsficant shot-noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., Loss) should provide stronger con- strained and provide a more robust test of these high bulk flow measurements in the literature. In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters b and vp for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation be- tweet these two parameters because the anisotropic am- plitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity fiends. The best fit value from Fig- ure 5 is vp = 270+433 km/s (at the 1s level marginalized with other parameters including b) and is consistent with vp = 0. We do not quote the negative bound of the error on vp as it is below zero and thus has no physical mean- ing. Instead, we quote the upper bound on vp and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of vp is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a WMAP5-normalized LCan model. We propose above that vp is a complementary param- ever for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter gTh, which is equivalent to fs8, is not de- terminus precisely without the prior information of As. But when we report our measurement with vp, there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to g*Th determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value vp at a given redshift is not only in- dependent of bias but also independent of normalization. B. Reconstruction of matter density fiend from vp We convert vp measurement into gTh using As from WMAP5 (gTh: coherent growth factor of peculiar below- ity, and it is equivalent to fs8 in other parameteriza- lions). With the evolution of gTh known, dynamics of per- turbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ps through the Ruler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z 0.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of Th into the coherent evolution of Ps. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the cover- ent evolution of Ph, gPh. We are able to determine matter density flsituations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the cover- ent growth of dm, gd = 0.7, which is related to gPh as",0.21756688541140837,0.8980312973245835,0.17895002523977788,0.17566885411408378,0.12089853609288238,0.06511862695608278,0.12291771832407875,0.5426552246340233,0.17566885411408378,0.044169611307420496,8,science_sample

14,0,"information between adjacent tokens in the data. This morre- spends to maximizing the likelihood of the data assuming a bigram model. The benefit of using word classes is that the resulting language model can have fewer parameters than a word-based n-gram model. In our case, the in-domain training text is so small that it can be a real advantage to have fewer parameters to learn in the language model. The problem is that if the data is too small to reliably estimate word transition probabilities (p(wi|wi-1)), then it will also be difficult to learn a good partitioning of the words into classes. Our hypothesis is that the advantage in learning the word class assignments on the Twitter data, which solves the data sparsely problem, outweighs any performance penalty that is incurred due to domain mis-match. This differs from the traditional approach where the class assignments (wi cj) are learned from the same training text which is used to estimate the class transition probabilities (p(ci|ci-1)) and the word probabilities (p(wi|cj)). Twitter data, in these experiments, refers to the concatenation of the text downloaded from Twitter with our in-domain data for the reasons described above. The experiments in Section In-C will compare learning the class assignments on out-of-domain data (hybrid method) to the traditional approach (baseline). In. EXPERIMENTS A. Experimental Data The in-domain data used in the experiments in this paper comes from the IARPA Babel program.1 This program focuses on keyword search for low-resource languages. The languages are low resource in the sense that they have fewer native speakers than the languages receiving the most attention from researchers and also in the sense that the provided training data is small in comparison to what is typically used. We exclusively focused on the so-called limited language pack, which consists of only ten hours of recorded telephone convey- nations. Our experiments were conducted using the Bengali, Tamil, Turkish and Zulu languages. The languages that we selected for our experiments have the largest vocabulary sizes (See Table I) of the languages in the Babel program and thus suffer the most from the data sparsely problem. As a point of comparison, Catalog, which was not used in our experiments, has one third as many vocabulary items as Tamil.",0.19897523484201537,0.16011955593509822,0.04953031596925705,0.14773697694278395,0.215200683176772,0.09521776259607173,0.21135781383432964,0.2412467976088813,0.11058923996584116,0.0990606319385141,14,science_sample

18,0,"For this purpose, we look at the temperature seven- dance of the rotation angle of the magnetization between Ns planes. In Fig. 7, phl(T ) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1 . . . 4. For both thicknesses, a monotypic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature T To(8), an abrupt drop of ph3 and ph4, which rapidly reach an almost con- start value, only slightly larger than ph1. In the tem- perature range To(8) T < To(8) we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all Ns layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-Ft confiduration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position Az,max of the structure factor S(0, 0, qz). In Fig. 8 the average of Az,max vs T is reported, again for n = 8 and for diffevent lateral dimer- signs L26. As expected from the previous argument, we see that Az,max = 0 for To(8) < T < To(8), while it be- wins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below To(8), making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with Az,max = 0 and reaching a value of about 21*for T = 10 K. In a previous study, where the magnetic properties of Ho thin films were investigated by My simulations of a Heidelberg model with easy-plane single-ion anisotropy and six out-of-plane coupling constants (as obtained by experimental neutron scattering measurements16) on a His lattice14,15, it was found that for thicknesses comma- table with the helical pitch the phase diagram landscape is quite diffevent from what we find here. Indeed, for n = 9 -16, three diffevent magnetic phases could be sin- fled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layers blocks coexist with some inner dis- ordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the sig- natures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one. The absence of the block phase in the J1 -J2 model here investigated has to be attributed to the diffevent range of interactions, rather than to the diffevent lattice structure. We came to this conclusion by doing some simulations using the same set of interaction constants employed in Refs. 14,15, but using a But lattice: the results we obtained for phl with n = 12 are reported in Fig. 9. The latter is absolutely similar to Fig.7 of Ref. 15 and clearly displays the bookmarks of the block phase (see down-triangle), with two external blocks of ordered layers ( l =1. . . 5 and 8. . . 12 ), where phl is roughly 10*, sep- stated by a block of disordered layers, and with almost",0.40606483095155105,0.8082955733705124,0.14220982920878356,0.4918089926803764,0.26734053677239455,0.3802718717323109,0.2767514813523876,0.44231439525967237,0.4918089926803764,0.4102474729871035,18,science_sample

Such costs increased to $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 from $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in direct operating costs is primarily attributable to costs associated with operating the increased number of Arts in the network during the periods. Also, intercompany allocations were made to charge the And operations with transaction switching and bank connection fees associated with the operations central processing center in Budapest. These allocations totalled $3.5 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Direct operating costs for 2000 include a one-time gain of $1.2 million due to a change in Hungarian law that eliminates a major portion of the Company's liability for import taxes on And hardware.

92,2,"Exploration is a key growth driver for Santos and success with the drill bit is vital to adding value for Santos shareholders. During the past four years Santos has been working to build exploration opportunities by: * acquiring new exploration acreage * adding material exploration prospects * drilling wildcat exploration wells. SUCCESS RArr Of 44% In 2004 Santos' 2004 exploration effort produced good results, as the Company high graded its exploration acreage and started drilling one of the most exciting portfolios in the industry. Santos discovered hydrocarbons in seven of the sixteen wildcat wells that were drilled, achieving an impressive success rate of 44%. The program added at least 93 million boe (including the pre-drill estimate for Jesus) of recoverable resources that will be further evaluated by delineating and, in some cases, production history to determine 1P and 2P reserve additions. Importantly, these results were achieved with financial discipline, spending $126 million which was substantially less than forecast. The most significant drilling result for the year was the Jesus oil discovery in the Samsung Per offshore East Java, Indonesia. The Jesus discovery is still under evaluation but its commercial significance appears encouraging. Santos has confirmed an oil column of at least 379 metres with a likely gross recoverable resource in excess of the pre-drill estimate of 170 million barrels. Santos also had further exploration successes in the Cooper Basin in central Australia where four of six wildcat wells were based and suspended as gas discoveries. There was also success in the offshore Stray Basin with the Martha gas discovery near the Casino field, which is currently being evaluated to determine its commercial significance. Additional drilling is planned to occur nearby in 2005 to follow up this encouraging result. Santos discovered gas in the United States at the Torres 1A onshore well, which was brought onto production only two months after drilling was completed. Other wells in the offshore Stray Basin included the deep water Merit 1 well, which was plugged and abandoned after failing to intersect economic hydrocarbons, and Callister 1 which was also plugged and abandoned with gas shows.",0.03198578409595735,0.9840071079520213,0.03287427809862283,0.033762772101288314,0.03243003109729009,0.4162594402487783,0.034207019102621056,0.03243003109729009,0.030208796090626388,0.043980453131941356,92,finance_samples

98,1,"In 2004, Santos continued its normal business of actively managing its portfolio through the investment of non-core assets and the acquisition of assets that fit well with existing Santos assets or can add to the ability of the Company to meet its strategic goals. As a result of this activity, Santos realised an after-tax profit of $47.4 million on oil and gas asset sales and will continue to high-grade its portfolio on an ongoing basis. Santos entered into an agreement with Px Medio during the first half of 2004 to acquire some of Novus Petroleum's Indonesian and Cooper Basin assets conditional on the success of Px Medio's takeover offer for Novus, which was ultimately successful. Specifically, Santos announced in September 2004 that it had executed formal agreements to acquire an additional 4.75% of the South Australian Cooper Basin, 18% of the Brandes Per and 9% of the Kazan Per from Medio for Up$110 million. On 31 December 2004, Santos paid Medio Up$98 million for the majority of the assets, with payment for the remaining 2.75% of Kazan Per expected to be made in the first quarter of 2005. This acquisition was an important piece in the strategic puzzle to tie up access to follow-up potential from the successful exploration at Jesus and to provide a production base for the newly established Indonesian core area. Also during the first half of 2004, Santos divested its remaining 18.4% shareholding in Magellan Petroleum Australia Ltd, raising approximately $10.6 million. Early in the second half of 2004, Santos concluded the sale of its non-core onshore Stray Basin interests to Origin Energy for $25.75 million.

100,0,"This has resulted in an extraordinarily fast reduction in active drilling rigs in the Up slowing the pace of growth which will ultimately and unavoidable lead to supply restrictions from the Up. While the rig count reduction is encouraging, some of the wells drilled prior to the reduction are still waiting upon completion and the remaining active rigs continue to drill away meaning new wells will continue to come online with high flush production so we are unlikely to see a flattering and ultimate reduction in Up supply until late this year. The good news is that high initial production rates fade fast so, as long as prices stay relatively low, there is likely to be a material decline in U.S. production (say 8-9%) over the course of 2016.",0.0066844919786096255,0.7740641711229946,0.0066844919786096255,0.0066844919786096255,0.0066844919786096255,0.020053475935828877,0.0066844919786096255,0.0066844919786096255,0.0066844919786096255,0.017379679144385027,100,finance_samples

This has been achieved by focusing on 'basin excellence'. This means becoming a technical leader in basins, within our focus areas, entering early where possible to keep entry costs down, balancing the commercial and the technical risks and selecting the right co-lecturers. An example of this is the strong position Santos has created in the Outer Basin, with interests in three neighbouring production sharing contracts: Popovi, Donggala and Papalang. 2004 also marked the year that Santos drilled its first operated deep water wells - a significant achievement for a company that had its beginnings in a desert environment.",0.36608187134502923,0.7871345029239766,0.4023391812865497,0.36023391812865496,0.3508771929824561,0.36608187134502923,0.36257309941520466,0.3894736842105263,0.3649122807017544,0.3684210526315789,101,finance_samples

117,2,"[0020] For. 1 illustrates a schematic cross-section view of a system 10 according to a first embodiment for the deposition of a thin-film coating onto a flexible sub- strata 12 (shown in profile in For. 1), such as a web of plastic film or metal foil, for example. With reference to For. 1, system 10 includes first and second precursor zones 14 and 16, respectively, separated by an interim- diane isolation zone 20 in which an inert fluid is present. The inert fluid may comprise an inert liquid, but more preferably consists essentially of an inert gas, such as nitrogen (N2). When in use, reactive first and second pre- cursor gases (Precursor 1 and Precursor 2) are intro- faced into the respective first and second precursor zones 14,16 from first and second precursor delivery sys- tens 24, 26. Precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clade precursor source containers (not shown) located outside or within precursor zones 14, 16. Additionally or alternatively, precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clade piping, pumps, valves, tanks, and other associated equipment for supplying precursor gases into precursor zones 14, 16. An inert gas delivery system 28 is similarly included for injecting inert gas into isolation zone 20.",0.03387096774193549,0.9862903225806452,0.03467741935483871,0.03387096774193549,0.03387096774193549,0.10483870967741936,0.03387096774193549,0.03387096774193549,0.03387096774193549,0.03387096774193549,117,patents
117,3,"[0021] In the embodiment shown, precursor zones 14,16 and isolation zone 20 are defined and bordered by an outer reaction chamber housing or vessel 30, divided by first and second dividend 34, 36 into three sub-chan- bars, namely, a first precursor chamber 44, a second precursor chamber 46 and an inert gas chamber 50. Ves- sel 30 may comprise a pressure vessel or vacuum vessel substantially isolating the process space from the enter- nal environment. In other embodiments, the vessel 30 may have entrance and exit passageways for interfering with other process modules or equipment, as described below with reference to For. 4. A series of first passage- ways 54 through first divider 34 are spaced apart along a general direction of travel of substrate 12, and a cor- responding series of second passageways 56 are pro- video through second divider 36. The passageways 54, 56 are arranged and configured for substrate 12 to be threaded therethrough back and forth between first and second precursor zones 14,16 multiple times, and each time through isolation zone 20. For a web substrate, pas- sideways 54, 56 preferably comprise slits having a width (exaggerated in For. 1) that is slightly greater than the thickness of substrate 12 and a length (not shown) ex- tending into the plane of For.1 (i.e., normal to the page) and that is slightly greater than a width of the substrate. Isolation zone 20 is, thus, preferably separated (albeit imperfectly) from the first precursor zone 14 by first di- video 34 and from second precursor zone 16 by second divider 36.",0.03380102040816327,0.985969387755102,0.03380102040816327,0.03380102040816327,0.03380102040816327,0.10522959183673469,0.03380102040816327,0.03380102040816327,0.03380102040816327,0.03380102040816327,117,patents
117,4,"[0022] To substantially prevent non-And reactions caused by mixing of nonadsorbed quantities of the first and second precursor gases in one of the chambers 44, 46, 50, it is necessary for the system 10 to inhibit the migration of Precursor 1 from first precursor zone 14 into isolation zone 20 and the migration of Precursor 2 from second precursor zone 16 into isolation zone 20. Pas- sideways 54, 56 are preferably configured to restrict the flow of gases between the zones 14,16, 20, to avoid or limit diffusion of precursor gases into a common zone. Passageways 54, 56 may include slits sized only slightly thicker and wider than the thickness and width of the substrate passing through them, leaving only a very small amount of headroom and margins to allow substrate 12 to pass therethrough without scraping against the sides of the passageways. For example, headroom and mar- wins may range between mirrors and millimeters in cer- tain embodiments. The passageways 54, 56 may also include elongate tunnels through which the substrate 12 passes, as depicted in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4. Such slits and tunnels are sometimes referred to as slit valves, although no actual moving valve gate is utilized. In some embed- idents, the passageways 54, 56 include a wider for fur- ther restricting flow. In one such embodiment, the sub- strata is threaded through opposing leaves of resilient material, such as a synthetic rubber, which wipe against opposing surfaces of the substrate.",0.023712737127371274,0.9850948509485095,0.023712737127371274,0.029132791327913278,0.023712737127371274,0.10094850948509485,0.023712737127371274,0.023712737127371274,0.03048780487804878,0.023712737127371274,117,patents
117,5,"[0023] In an alternate embodiment (not shown), the inert gas chamber 50 of isolation zone 20 and dividend 34, 36 are eliminated, so that isolation zone 20 essentially consists of a series of long narrow passageways extend- ing completely between precursor zones 14,16. In such an embodiment, no common inert gas chamber 50 con- nests the passageways, so inert gas is injected directly into the passageways mentally of the first and second precursor zones 14,16 to help prevent precursor nigra- tion and mixing. Isolation zone 20 of this embodiment would include a manifold, or a number of manifolds, for routing inert gas lines to puzzles along the sides of the passageways. The manifold or manifolds would be formed in the material of the reaction chamber bordering the passageways, and may be connected to an inert gas delivery system along the sides of the system, rather than at an end of the system as shown in For. 1.",0.023835319609967497,0.9837486457204767,0.023835319609967497,0.032502708559046585,0.023835319609967497,0.10834236186348863,0.023835319609967497,0.023835319609967497,0.03466955579631636,0.023835319609967497,117,patents

In one embody- ment, the pressure differentiate may be generated by in- meeting inert gas into isolation zone 20 at a pressure great- er than the operating pressure of the precursor zones 14, 16, and then passively exhausting gases from the precursor zones 14, 16.
