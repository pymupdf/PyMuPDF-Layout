**2.4 Ways to submit a tender: how can economic operators**

**organise themselves to submit a tender?**


Economic operators can submit a tender either as a sole tenderer or as a group of tenderers.
In either case subcontracting is permitted.


In order to fulfil the selection criteria, as set out in **section 3.2,** the tenderer can rely on the
capacities of subcontractors or other entities (that are not subcontractors).


The role of each entity involved in a tender (hereafter referred to as “the involved entity”)
must be clearly specified in the e-Submission application: i) sole tenderer, ii) group leader of
a group of tenderers, iii) member of a group of tenderers, or iv) subcontractor. For an entity
on whose capacities the tenderer relies to fulfil the selection criteria (that is not a
subcontractor), this role is defined in the commitment letter ( **Annex 07** ). This applies also
where the involved entities belong to the same economic group.


In particular, the tenderer must provide a detailed overview of all companies involved in
the tender; clearly describing how the work will be distributed (share and exact distribution
of responsibilities) and explaining from which location the different services will be
delivered.


**2.4.1.** **Joint tenders**


A joint tender is a situation where a tender is submitted by a group (with or without legal
form) of economic operators regardless of the link they have between them. The group as a
whole is considered a tenderer [9] .


All members of the group assume joint and several liability towards the _Contracting Authority_
for the performance of the contract as a whole.


Group members must appoint a _Group Leader_ and a single point of contact authorised to
act on their behalf in connection with the submission of the tender and all relevant
questions, clarification requests, notifications, etc., that may be received during the
evaluation, award and until the contact signature. The model power of attorney attached in
**Annex 04 “Power of Attorney”** is to be used.


Changes in the composition of the group during the procurement procedure (after the
submission deadline and before contract signature) shall lead to rejection of the tender except
in case of:


9 References to _tenderer_ or _tenderers_ in this document shall be understood as covering both sole tenderers and
groups of economic operators submitting a joint tender.
