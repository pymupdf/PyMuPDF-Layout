Appendix B: Leading singularities at the shadow
mass shell, ω ∼ k y to the fourth order.


In this appendix we evaluate the singular contributions
to the Green function at the shadow mass shell, ω ∼ k y
to fourth order in the coupling constant. We start with
the expression (A1) introduced in App. A 1. In contrast
to the discussion in App. A 1 we anticipate the singularity at ω = k y to come from the region y 2 ≫ x 2, and
introduce new variables accordingly, x 2 = ξy 2, y 1 = ηy 2 .
Performing integration over y 2 we obtain



1 [+][ y] 1 [2] [|] [d] [|][x] [2] 1 [+ (][y] [2] [ −] [y] [1] [)] [2] [|] [d]
C = [|][x] [2] . (A11)

|x 1 | [2][d] |y 2 [2] [+][ x] [2] 1 [|] [d]



We write


ABC −B −C +1 = (A− 1)BC +(B −1)(C −1) . (A12)


It is apparent form Eq. (A12) that the leading singularity
originates from the first term, (A − 1)BC ≈ A − 1 ≈
−2d(y 1 − 0)(y 3 − y 2 ). Introducing new variables as in the
Sec. III and integrating over x i s we obtain

Here again, the integrals are divergent on the upper limit.
Similarly to the previous section we differentiate it once
with respect to the variable α introduced in Eq. (14) in
order to isolate the leading logarithmic singularity,

We notice that the singularity at ω ∼ k y comes from the
region of small ξ. Therefore we keep only the first term
in the square brackets in Eq. (B1). After performing
remaining integrations over ξ i s we obtain


Σ [(4)] = [i(][Ja] [d] [)] [4] [Γ(1] (−i( [ −] ω − [2][d][)Γ(2] k x )) [3] [ −] [−][4] [2] [d] [d][)][α] [2][−][2][d] . (B2)


We stress that contrary to the mass shell singularities
discussed in App. A, where it was important to compute
the self-energy, at the shadow mass shell it is enough to
consider the Green function itself.
