Creating Opportunities

# DELIVERING ON THE EXPLORATION STRATEGY



Exploration is a key growth driver

for Santos and success with the

drill bit is vital to adding value

for Santos shareholders. During

the past four years Santos has

been working to build exploration

opportunities by:


- acquiring new

exploration acreage


- adding material

exploration prospects


- drilling wildcat

exploration wells.


**SUCCESS RATE OF 44% IN 2004**

Santos’ 2004 exploration effort

produced good results, as the

Company high graded its

exploration acreage and started

drilling one of the most exciting

portfolios in the industry.


Santos discovered hydrocarbons

in seven of the sixteen wildcat



The program added at least
93 million boe (including the
pre-drill estimate for Jeruk) of

recoverable resources that will be

further evaluated by delineation

and, in some cases, production

history to determine 1P and 2P

reserve additions.


Importantly, these results were

achieved with financial discipline,

spending $126 million which was

substantially less than forecast.


The most significant drilling

result for the year was the Jeruk

oil discovery in the Sampang PSC

offshore East Java, Indonesia.

The Jeruk discovery is still under

evaluation but its commercial

significance appears encouraging.

Santos has confirmed an oil

column of at least 379 metres

with a likely gross recoverable

resource in excess of the pre-drill

estimate of 170 million barrels.



Cooper Basin in central Australia

where four of six wildcat wells

were cased and suspended as

gas discoveries.


There was also success in the

offshore Otway Basin with the

Martha gas discovery near the

Casino field, which is currently

being evaluated to determine

its commercial significance.

Additional drilling is planned to

occur nearby in 2005 to follow

up this encouraging result.


Santos discovered gas in the

United States at the Torres 1A

onshore well, which was brought

onto production only two months

after drilling was completed.


Other wells in the offshore Otway

Basin included the deep water

Amrit 1 well, which was plugged

and abandoned after failing to

intersect economic hydrocarbons,

**explorers. We started drilling**

**one of the most exciting**

**portfolios in our industry and**

**our success to date shows that**

**our strategy of basin excellence**

**is delivering.’**
