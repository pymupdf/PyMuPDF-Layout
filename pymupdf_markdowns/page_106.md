of, non-executive, independent

Directors, except for the

Environmental and Safety

Committee, which includes

the CEO as a member.


The Board Guidelines prescribe

that the Board is to meet at

least eight times a year,

including a strategy meeting of

two days duration. The number

of meetings of the Board and of

each of its Committees and the

names of attendees at those

meetings are set out on page 47

of this Annual Report. Board

Meetings are structured in two

separate sessions, without

management present for one of

those sessions. The agenda for

meetings is prepared by the

Company Secretary in

conjunction with the Chairman

and CEO, with periodic input

from the Board. Comprehensive

Board papers are distributed to

Directors in advance of

scheduled meetings. Board

meetings take place both at the

Company’s head office and at key

operating sites, to assist the

Board in its understanding of

operational issues.


Executive management attend

Board and Committee meetings,

at which they report to Directors

within their respective areas of

responsibility. This assists the

Board in maintaining its

understanding of the Company’s

business and assessing the

executive management team.

Where appropriate, advisors to

the Company attend meetings of

the Board and of its Committees.


**2.3 Composition of the Board**

The composition of the Board is

determined in accordance with

the Company’s Constitution and

the Board Guidelines which,

among other things, require that:


30 Annual Report 2004




- the Board is to comprise

a minimum of five and a

maximum of ten Directors

(exclusive of the CEO);


- the Board should comprise a

substantial majority of

independent, non-executive

Directors;


- there should be a separation

of the roles of Chairman and

Chief Executive Officer of the

Company; and


- the Chairman of the Board

should be an independent,

non-executive Director.


Under the Company’s

Constitution approximately one
third of Directors retire by

rotation each year and Directors

appointed during the year are

required to submit themselves

for election by shareholders at

the Company’s next Annual

General Meeting. The Board

Guidelines encourage Directors to

retire at the first Annual General

Meeting after reaching the age

of 72 years and not seek re
appointment.


Currently, the Board comprises

eight non-executive Directors

and one executive Director. The

Board has adopted the definition

set out in the ASX Best Practice

Recommendations and as defined

in the 2002 guidelines of the

Investment and Financial

Services Association Limited and

considers all current non
executive Directors, including the

Chairman, to be independent

directors.


Generally, the Board considers a

Director to be independent if he

or she is not a member of

management and is free of any

business or other relationship

that could materially interfere

with, or could reasonably be



perceived to materially interfere

with, the Director’s ability to

act in the best interests of the

Company. The Board will assess

the materiality of any given

relationship that may affect

independence on a case by case

basis and has adopted

materiality guidelines to assist in

that assessment. Under these

guidelines, the following

interests are regarded as material

in the absence of any mitigating

factors:


- a holding of 5% or more of

the Company’s voting shares or

a direct association with an

entity that holds more than

5% of the Company’s voting

shares;


- an affiliation with an entity

which accounts for 5% or more

or the revenue or expense of

the Company.


The Board has determined that

there should not be any arbitrary

length of tenure that should be

considered to materially interfere

with a Director’s ability to act in

the best interests of the

Company, as it believes this

assessment must be made on a

case by case basis with reference

to the length of service of all

members of the Board.


Each Director’s independence is

assessed by the Board on an

individual basis, with reference

to the above materiality

guidelines and focussing on an

assessment of each Director’s

capacity to bring independence

of judgment to Board decisions.

In this context, as mentioned

below, Directors are required to

promptly disclose their interests

in contracts and other

directorships and offices held.


The names and details of the

experience, qualifications, special



responsibilities, and term of

office of each Director of the

Company are set out on page 41

of this Annual Report. Details

of each Director’s attendance at

Board and Committee Meetings

and their shareholdings are also

set out on page 47 of this

Annual Report.


**2.4 Nomination Committee**

The role, responsibilities and

membership requirements of

the Nomination Committee are

documented in the Board

Guidelines and in a separate

Charter, approved by the Board.


Under the Board Guidelines,

it is the responsibility of the

Nomination Committee to devise

the criteria for, and review

membership of, and nominations

to, the Board. The primary

criteria adopted in selection of

suitable Board candidates is their

capacity to contribute to the

ongoing development of the

Company having regard to the

location and nature of the

Company’s significant business

interests and to the candidates’

age and experience by reference

to the attributes of existing

Board members.


When a Board vacancy exists or

where it is considered that the

Board would benefit from the

services of a new Director with

particular skills, the Nomination

Committee has responsibility for

proposing candidates for

consideration by the Board and,

where appropriate, engages the

services of external consultants.


Prior to appointment, each

Director is provided with a letter

of appointment which encloses a

copy of the Company’s

Constitution and of the relevant

policies. Additionally, the

expectations of the Board in
