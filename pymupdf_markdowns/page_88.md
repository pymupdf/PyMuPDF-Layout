### **Nueva Esperanza** **Project**

##### Chile Summary

The Nueva Esperanza Project is 100% owned
by Kingsgate since February 2012. Nueva
Esperanza is located in the Maricunga Gold Belt
near Copiapó, a regional mining centre in
Northern Chile. The silver-rich mineralisation is
hosted by the Esperanza high-sulphidation
epithermal alteration system associated with
the Cerros Bravos volcanic complex.


A feasibility study for a decision to mine the
Arqueros portion of Nueva Esperanza was
completed in late 2012, demonstrating that open
pit mining at two million tonnes per year and
processing by milling and agitation leaching in
cyanide was technically feasible. Work remained
to integrate the Teterita and Chimberos deposits
into the project, as well as to test lower cost
options for processing. Continued metallurgical
testwork has shown that mineralisation from all
three deposits by heap leaching is technically and
economically feasible and the preferred alternative for development.


Environmental approvals to commence
construction and mining at Nueva Esperanza
were granted in July 2013 for the original
Arqueros project. Work is underway to modify
and update the environmental assessment to
incorporate the heap leach process.
