FIG. 4: An ordered list of the Eigenvalues for our cluster covariance matrix.


Before we invert Cij in Eqn. 12, we note that the values
of Cij are estimated to limited resolution,

Njk



and therefore, if Njk is small, or there are degeneracies
within Cij, the inversion will be affected. This problem
can be eliminated by performing a Single Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix,


Cij = Uik [†] [D][kl][V][lj] [,] (15)
