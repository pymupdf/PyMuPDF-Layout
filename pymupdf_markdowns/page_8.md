evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed
cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity. In this paper, we provide a first demonstration of our new parameterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In
detail, we attempt to model the “squashing” of the 2D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in
Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do
however caution the reader that we expect the limited
size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical errors, due to a significant shot–noise contribution because
of their low number density. However, future cluster and
galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger constraints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk
flow measurements in the literature.
In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters b and
v p for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure
3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation between these two parameters because the anisotropic amplitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density
and peculiar velocity fields. The best fit value from Figure 5 is v p = 270 [+433] km/s (at the 1σ level marginalised
with other parameters including b) and is consistent with
v p = 0. We do not quote the negative bound of the error
on v p as it is below zero and thus has no physical meaning. Instead, we quote the upper bound on v p and note
that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement
of v p is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a
WMAP5–normalised ΛCDM model.

We propose above that v p is a complementary parameter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements.
The parameter g Θ, which is equivalent to fσ 8, is not determined precisely without the prior information of A S .
But when we report our measurement with v p, there is no
uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which
are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to g Θ [∗]
determined statistically from redshift space distortion.
The observed value v p at a given redshift is not only independent of bias but also independent of normalisation.


B. Reconstruction of matter density field from v p


We convert v p measurement into g Θ using A s from
WMAP5 (g Θ : coherent growth factor of peculiar velocity, and it is equivalent to fσ 8 in other parameterizations). With the evolution of g Θ known, dynamics of perturbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ψ
through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models,
the time variation of v p is minimal at these low redshifts
discussed here for the C4 sample (z ≃ 0.1), which allows
us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore,
it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution
of Θ into the coherent evolution of Ψ. If we assume no
anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coherent evolution of Φ, g Φ .
We are able to determine matter density fluctuations
through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coherent growth of δ m, g δ = 0.7, which is related to g Φ as

and therefore, if N jk is small, or there are degeneracies
within C ij, the inversion will be affected. This problem
can be eliminated by performing a Single Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix,


C ij = U ik [†] [D] [kl] [V] [lj] [,] (15)


where U and V are orthogonal matrices that span the
range and the null space of C ij and D kl = λ [2] δ kl, a diagonal matrix with singular values along the diagonal. In
doing the SVD, we select the dominant modes to contribute to the χ [2] by requiring that λ [2] - �2/N jk .

In Figure 4, we rank the eigenvalues (λ i ) for the increasing eigenmodes and see a “kink” in the distribution which we interpret as indicating a transition in the
signal–to–noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the first ten
modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered
modes are dominated by noise. We therefore remove
eigenmodes beyond this kink (with λ i < 0.01) where the
eigenvalues start to flatten out.


A. Statistical determination of large scale flow


As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evidence for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the
WMAP5-normalised ΛCDM model [18] and therefore, it
is important to confirm these results as it may indicate
