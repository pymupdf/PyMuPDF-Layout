where κ0, κa are two real-valued positive constants and
0 ≤ k ≤ π. The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming Im(Ea) = 0, is a special case of
the FFA model previously investigated in Ref.[36], which
is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of H spans the band (E1, E2), with
E2 = −E1 = 2κ0. The density of states for this model is
given by

FIG. 2: Domains of non-existence of bound states for the
Hamiltonian H in the (Im(Ea)/κ0, κa/κ0) plane (shaded regions) for increasing values of the ratio |Re(Ea)|/κ0. For a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im(Ea) ̸= 0, in the shaded
regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely
continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of
the shaded regions.

κa/κ0 ≤ √2 and shrinks toward Im(Ea)/κ0 = κa/κ0 = 0

as |Re(Ea)/κ0| → 2 [−] . For |Re(Ea)/κ0| ≤ 2, bound states
do exist for any value of κa/κ0 and Im(Ea)/κ0. The
wider domain is attained for Re(Ea) = 0. In particular,
for Re(Ea) = 0 and κa/κ0 = √2, from Eq.(52) it follows

that H has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that


− 2κ0 < Im(Ea) < 2κ0. (53)


Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs.(19) and (20) and using Eqs.(49)
and (51), a spectral singularity at energy E = E0, inside the interval (−2κ0, 2κ0), is found provided that the
following two equations are simultaneously satisfied

For arbitrarily given values of Ea, κa and κ0, the
above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for
E0 in the range (−2κ0, 2κ0)], i.e. the non-Hermitian
FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spectral singularities appear solely when a constraint among
Re(Ea)/κ0, Im(Ea)/κ0 and κa/κ0 is satisfied. Let us
first assume κa/κ0 strictly smaller that √2. In this

case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy E0 =



Then the Hamiltonian H has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if |ξ1,2| ≤ 1. Figure 2 shows the domain
in the plane (Im(Ea)/κ0, κa/κ0) where H has a purely
continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values
of the ratio |Re(Ea)/κ0|. The domain lies in the sector
