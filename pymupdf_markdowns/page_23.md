A. The Hamiltonian


Let us consider the non-Hermitian FFA model defined
by the following relations for the energy dispersion E(k)
and spectral coupling v(k)

where κ 0, κ a are two real-valued positive constants and
0 ≤ k ≤ π. The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming Im(E a ) = 0, is a special case of
the FFA model previously investigated in Ref.[36], which
is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of H spans the band (E 1, E 2 ), with
E 2 = −E 1 = 2κ 0 . The density of states for this model is
given by

FIG. 2: Domains of non-existence of bound states for the
Hamiltonian H in the (Im(E a )/κ 0, κ a /κ 0 ) plane (shaded regions) for increasing values of the ratio |Re(E a )|/κ 0 . For a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im(E a ) ̸= 0, in the shaded
regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely
continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of
the shaded regions.

κ a /κ 0 ≤ √2 and shrinks toward Im(E a )/κ 0 = κ a /κ 0 = 0

as |Re(E a )/κ 0 | → 2 [−] . For |Re(E a )/κ 0 | ≤ 2, bound states
do exist for any value of κ a /κ 0 and Im(E a )/κ 0 . The
wider domain is attained for Re(E a ) = 0. In particular,
for Re(E a ) = 0 and κ a /κ 0 = √2, from Eq.(52) it follows

that H has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that


− 2κ 0 < Im(E a ) < 2κ 0 . (53)


Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs.(19) and (20) and using Eqs.(49)
and (51), a spectral singularity at energy E = E 0, inside the interval (−2κ 0, 2κ 0 ), is found provided that the
following two equations are simultaneously satisfied

The condition for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to possess a real-valued spectrum (i.e. to avoid complex-valued
energies arising from bound states outside the continuum) is derived in Appendix B. Precisely, let ξ 1,2 be the
two roots of the second-order algebraic equation

For arbitrarily given values of E a, κ a and κ 0, the
above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for
E 0 in the range (−2κ 0, 2κ 0 )], i.e. the non-Hermitian
FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spectral singularities appear solely when a constraint among
Re(E a )/κ 0, Im(E a )/κ 0 and κ a /κ 0 is satisfied. Let us
first assume κ a /κ 0 strictly smaller that √2. In this

case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy E 0 =



Then the Hamiltonian H has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if |ξ 1,2 | ≤ 1. Figure 2 shows the domain
in the plane (Im(E a )/κ 0, κ a /κ 0 ) where H has a purely
continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values
of the ratio |Re(E a )/κ 0 |. The domain lies in the sector
