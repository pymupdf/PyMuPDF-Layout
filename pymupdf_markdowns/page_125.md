carbon-based acid-decomposable resin, in particular the following performances, becomes possible, that is,

(1) Solubility in a coating solvent,



5 [(2) A film-forming property (a glass transition point), ]


(3) Alkali developability,


(4) Decrease of layer thickness (hydrophobic/hydrophilic
properties, selection of an alkali-soluble group),


10 (5) Adhesion of an unexposed area to a substrate, and


(6) Dry etching resistance.
The examples of such monomers include compounds having one addition polymerizable unsaturated bond selected

15 [from acrylic esters, methacrylic esters, acrylamides, meth-]
acryl-amides, ally! compounds, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, etc.
In addition to the aforementioned compounds, addition
polymerizable unsaturated compounds copolymerizable with
the monomers corresponding to the above various repeating

20 [structural units may be used for copolymerization. ]
In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable
resin, the molar ratio of the content of each repeating structural unit is arbitrarily set to adjust dry etching resistance,
aptitude for standard developing solutions of a resist, adhe
25 sion to a substrate, and resist profile, in addition, general
requisite performances of a resist, e.g., resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity.
As preferred embodiments of the alicyclic hydrocarbonbased acid-decomposable resin in the invention, the follow
30 ing resins are exemplified.

(1) Resin containing a repeating unit having a partial structure
containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of
formulae (pl) to (pV) (a side chain type), preferably resin
containing a repeating unit by (meth)acrylate having the

35 structure of any of formulae (pl) to (p V),


(2) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula
(II-AB) (a main chain type); however, the following is further
exemplified as embodiment (2),


40 (3) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula
(II-AB), a maleic anhydride derivative structure and a (meth)
acrylate structure (a hybrid type).
In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable
resin, the content of a repeating unit having an acid-decom
45 posable group is preferably from 10 to 60 mo! % in all the
repeating structural units, more preferably from 20 to 50 mo!
%, and still more preferably from 25 to 40 mo! %.
In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable
resin, the content of a repeating unit having a partial structure

50 containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of
formulae (pl) to (p V) is preferably from 25 to 70 mo! % in all
the repeating structural units, more preferably from 35 to 65
mo! %, and still more preferably from 40 to 60 mo! %.
In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable

55 resin, the content of a repeating unit represented by formula
(II-AB) is preferably from 10 to 60 mo!% in the total repeating structural units, more preferably from 15 to 55 mo!%, and
still more preferably from 20 to 50 mo!%.
The content of the repeating unit having a lactone group is

60 preferably from 10 to 70 mo! % in all the repeating structural
units, more preferably from 20 to 60 mo! %, and still more
preferably from 25 to 60 mo! %.
The content of the repeating unit having the alicyclic
hydrocarbon structure substituted with a polar group is pref
65 erably from 1 to 40 mo!% in all the repeating structural units,
more preferably from 5 to 30 mo!%, and still more preferably
from 5 to 20 mo! %.
