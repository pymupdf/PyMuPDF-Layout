across Santos operations. The
long-term environmental and
financial benefits of using this
technology are expected to be

considerable.


**REDUCED OIL SPILLS**

There was a substantial reduction

in the volume of hydrocarbons

released to the environment

in 2004, with uncontained

hydrocarbons spilt reducing from
1,943 cubic metres to 83 cubic

metres and Santos continues to

focus on reducing oil spills.


**GREENHOUSE POLICY**

Santos released its Greenhouse

Policy in 2004 to drive performance

improvements in this area through

reducing emissions and producing

oil and gas more efficiently.


Santos’ Greenhouse Policy is

being rolled out across the

organisation through cross
functional greenhouse gas teams

that have the right skill sets and

responsibilities to progress this

initiative. These teams will

manage Greenhouse Policy and

regulation, carbon management

and trading opportunities, and

energy efficiency. A key internal

driver for emissions reduction

will be the promotion of energy

efficiency.


Santos is committed to achieving

effective emission reduction

targets, to the pursuit of energy

efficiency strategies and to the

identification and implementation
