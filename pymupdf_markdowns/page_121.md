<Other Components>


**[0317]** The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a
surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are
described below.


(Photo-Acid Generator)


**[0318]** The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

**[0319]** The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of
generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or
radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may
be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator
for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical
photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an
acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which
are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof.
Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium
salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such
as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

**[0320]** Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator
include compounds represented by the following formulae
**(ZI),** **(ZII)** and **(ZIII):**
