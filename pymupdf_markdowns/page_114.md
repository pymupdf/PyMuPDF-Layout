**[0405]** The hydrophobic resin preferably has any one or
more of a "fluorine atom", a "silicon atom", and a "CH 3
partial structure which is contained in a side chain moiety of
a resin" from the viewpoint of uneven distribution on the
film surface layer, and more preferably has two or more
kinds. Incidentally, the hydrophobic resin preferably has a
hydrocarbon group having 5 or more carbon atoms. These
groups may be contained in the main chain of the resin or
may be substituted in the side chain.

**[0406]** In a case where hydrophobic resin includes a
fluorine atom and/or a silicon atom, the fluorine atom and/or
the silicon atom in the hydrophobic resin may be included in
the main chain or the side chain of the resin.

**[0407]** In a case where the hydrophobic resin includes a
fluorine atom, as a partial structure having a fluorine atom,
