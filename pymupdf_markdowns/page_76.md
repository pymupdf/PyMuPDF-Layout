_Figure 6-4  Create Pool dialog box_


Mark the **Data Reduction** check box to create the Data Reduction Pool. Leaving it unmarked
creates a standard storage pool.


A standard storage pool that is created by using the GUI has a default extent size of 1 GB.
Data Reduction Pools have a default extent size of 4 GB. The size of the extent is selected at
creation time and cannot be changed later.


If you want to specify a different extent size, you can enable this option by clicking **Settings** →
**GUI Preferences** → **General** and checking **Advanced pool settings**, as shown in
Figure 6-5.

When advanced pool settings are enabled, you can additionally select an extent size at
creation time, as shown in Figure 6-6 on page 195.
