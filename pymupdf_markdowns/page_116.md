TECHNICAL FIELD



The present invention relates to a pattern forming method
using a developer containing an organic solvent, which is
suitably used in a super micro lithography process such as a
manufacturing process of a super LSI or high capacity
microchip or other photofabrication processes, an electron
beam-sensitive or an extreme ultraviolet ray-sensitive resin
composition, and a resist film, and a method for manufacturing an electronic device, and an electronic device using
the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to



10 [an alicyclic group and a certain polystyrene repeating unit. ]
According to the document, the resolution and the sensitivity are said to be improved.


However, in a positive type image forming method, an
isolated line or dot pattern may be formed well, but the
15 shapes of patterns are easy to deteriorate when an isolated
space or fine hole patterns are formed.


In addition, a pattern forming method using a developer
containing an organic solvent has been developed recently

20 [(for example, see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open ]
No. 2010-217884). According to this method, it is said that
the stable formation of a micro pattern in high precision is
possible. Further, in recent years, the needs of the formation
of fine isolated space patterns and the refinement of hole



25 patterns are rapidly increasing. Because of this, a further

manufacturing process of a super LSI or high capacity space width roughness performance is required in the formicrochip or other photofabrication processes, an electron mation of fine isolated space patterns having a space width

BACKGROUND ART


A micromachining by a lithography using a photoresist
composition has been conducted in a conventional manufacturing process of a semiconductor device such as an IC or
LSI. Recently, an ultrafine pattern formation of a submicron
region or a quarter micron region has been required, because



40 forming method provides an excellent sensitivity, resolution,
and space width roughness performance in the formation of
fine isolated space patterns having a space width of 100 nm
or less, and also provides a high resolution, a good exposure
latitude (EL), and an excellent uniformity of local pattern
45 dimension (Local-CDU) in the case of forming a hole
pattern having fine pore diameter (for example, 50 nm or
less).



an integration level of an integrated circuit becomes higher. 50
Accordingly, an exposure wavelength has a tendency to
become shorter from g line to i line, and further to a KrF
excimer laser ray. Furthermore, development of a lithography using an electron beam or X-ray or EUV ray other than
the excimer laser ray is now progressing. 55

These electron beam or X-ray or EUV ray lithography
takes a position as a pattern forming technique of the next
generation or the next of the next generation, and a resist
composition of a high sensitivity and high resolution is
desired. Particularly, a high sensitization is a very important 60
problem to be solved for shortening of a processing time of
wafer. However, when intending to the high sensitization, a
resolution which is represented by a pattern shape or limiting resolution line width is prone to be reduced. Thus, the
development of a resist composition which is capable to 65
satisfy these characteristics at the same time is highly
demanded.

The present invention is as follows.


[1] A pattern forming method, including:


(a) forming a film by using an electron beam-sensitive or
extreme ultraviolet ray-sensitive resin composition containing a resin (A) having a repeating unit represented by
