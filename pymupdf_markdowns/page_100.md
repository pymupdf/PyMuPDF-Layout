As oil prices started to tumble, we reacted swiftly. In early November 2014, we began
terminating short-term service contracts (we had no long-term agreements), pushing
service providers to offer lower rates, extending drilling obligations with land owners,
and moderating forward capital deployment for drilling, leasing and acquisitions. These
actions are consistent with our core strategy of being a low cost operator and maintaining
a strong balance sheet as they have increased our flexibility in seeking ways to preserve
and ultimately grow shareholder value.


Because of our position as a low cost operator with a clean balance sheet, the Company
remains in a strong position to not only survive, but also to add both short and long-term
shareholder value during the pendency of this downturn in market prices.


**Forward Strategy**
As dire as the oil markets may appear today, they do remain very efficient in reacting
swiftly to changing prices. Logic would dictate that the highest cost barrel would be the
first off the market, but many of these high cost barrels come from long lead time projects
that have significant sunk costs so are comparatively slow to react. US shale plays, for
the most part, are not the marginal cost barrel but, because of the short lead times, are
often the quickest to react.


While the supply reaction is well under way, demand continues to grow with the economy
(net of efficiency improvements) meaning that, like often in history, market fundamentals
will ultimately come back into balance and beyond, resulting in a period of under-supply
and, therefore, higher than normal prices. While this scenario seems likely as a historical
matter, it is also virtually impossible to predict timing with any degree of accuracy.
Fortunately, since US shale is not the marginal cost barrel in the long term, it will survive,
become more efficient, and outperform in when prices ultimately recover.


Our shareholders will benefit from our exposure to some of the highest quality US shale
acreage and production in the Eagle Ford along with our leading cost structure and
strong balance sheet. While prices are down, we intend to invest capital in development
opportunities with reasonable returns and to maintain leases and sustain production
levels while protecting our balance sheet and patiently increasing the size and quality of
our drilling inventory.


To implement this strategy, we will continue to drive down development costs by
capitalizing on weak service demand and improving efficiency to create a sustainable
cost advantage, leasing expired mineral rights in our core areas relinquished by peers
with weaker balance sheets, and striving to acquire additional Eagle Ford assets with
current production within our current, conservative balance sheet parameters. By creating
a sustainable cost advantage and growing drilling inventory while prices are low, we
anticipate generating strong shareholder returns through this cycle.


Finally, our Company remains well positioned because of the hard and creative work put
forth by our employees, board of directors, partners, contractors, and consultants. With
prices low we have a new set of circumstances we can capitalize on to strengthen our
business. Thanks to each and every one of you for your continued focus and passion to
take the calculated risks needed for generating superior shareholder returns and building
a stable, flourishing enterprise.


Sincerely,
