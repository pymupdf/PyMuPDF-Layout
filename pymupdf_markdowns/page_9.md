IV. FITTING RESULTS


A. Model I


At first, we divide the whole region of redshift into 4 bins (i.e., m = 3), the divided


points and boundaries are (0, z1, z2, 1.8, ∞), where z1 and z2 are left as free parameters of


the model, and 0 < z1 < z2 < 1.8. In the fourth bin we set wL = −1. It means that we


divide the region with z ∈ (0, 1.8) into 3 bins and seek for two possible turning points of


wde(z) in this region. The reconstructed wde of the best-fitted model is shown in Fig. 1,
