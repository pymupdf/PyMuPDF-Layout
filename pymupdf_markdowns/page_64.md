|**Basis for**<br>**assessment**|A consolidated assessment of the tenderer as a whole (including, if<br>applicable, all members of a joint tender and/or other entities on which<br>the tenderer relies to fulfil this selection criterion) will be carried out.|
|**Evidence**|Tenderers must provide**minimum 10 (and in any case no more**<br>**than 20) contract references**. Evidence must be provided in the<br>form of a filled-in contract reference per project. For each contract<br>reference the use of the templates provided in**Annex 09** to this<br>document is mandatory. Only references submitted on these forms will<br>be considered. <br> <br>Tenderers who fail to provide a description, or who only provide generic<br>content, which does not specifically describe the relevance of the<br>contract reference with regard to the minimum level of capacity<br>detailed above, will be considered as not having the technical and<br>professional capacity to perform the contract.<br> <br>The references must concern at least 3 different clients. Departments,<br>divisions, directorates, and other entities of a same body (including the<br>same EU Institution) will be regarded as the same client. Each EU<br>Institution (including an EU agency) is considered a different client.<br>Under a framework contract (or framework contracts) with different<br>specific contracts, a specific contract (alone or in combination with<br>other specific contracts) can be used only once (i.e. it will be considered<br>as a single reference). In case of a joint tender, the same reference<br>contract cannot be submitted as a separate contract reference by<br>different economic operators for the same tender.<br>The Contracting Authority may request**statements issued by the**<br>**clients**, public or private, as supporting documents for each contract<br>reference. These documents should be ready to be provided within five<br>working days of the Contracting Authority’s request. The contact<br>persons for the customers indicated in the contract reference form may<br>be contacted in the context of this call for tenders to crosscheck the<br>validity of the information provided as evidence.|
