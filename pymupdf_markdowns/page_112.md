**[0484]** Subsequently, the resist film is irradiated with an
actinic ray or radiation, then preferably baked (usually at 80
to 150° C., preferably at 90 to 130° C.), and developed. By
performing baking, a more excellent pattern can be obtained.

**[0485]** Examples of the actinic ray or radiation include
infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, far ultraviolet
light, X-ray and electron beam. An actinic ray or radiation
having, for example, a wavelength of250 nm or less, particularly 220 nm or less, is preferred. Such an actinic ray or
radiation includes, for example, KrF excimer laser (248 nm),
ArF excimerlaser(193 nm), F 2 excimerlaser(157 nm), X-ray
and electron beam. The actinic ray or radiation is preferably,
for example, KrF excimer laser, electron beam, X-ray or EUV
light, more preferably electron beam, X-ray or EUV light.

**[0486]** That is, the present invention also relates to an
actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition
for KrF excimer laser, electron beam, X-ray or EUV light
(preferably electron beam, X-ray or EUV light).

**[0487]** In the development step, an alkali developer is usually used.

**[0488]** Examples of the alkali developer include an alkaline
aqueous solution containing inorganic alkalis such as sodium
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium
silicate, sodium metasilicate and aqueous annnonia, primary
amines such as ethylamine and n-propylamine, secondary
amines such as diethylamine and di-n-butylamine, tertiary
amines such as triethylamine and methyldiethylamine, alcohol amines such as dimethylethanolamine and triethanolamine, quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetraethylammonium hydroxide, or
cyclic amines such as pyrrole and piperidine.

**[0489]** In the alkali developer, alcohols and a surfactant
may be added in an appropriate amount.

**[0490]** The concentration of the alkali developer is usually
from 0.1 to 20 mass %. The pH of the alkali developer is
usually from 10.0 to 15.0.
