## **4. F ORM AND CONTENT OF THE TENDER** 

## **4.1. Form of the tender: how to submit the tender?** 

Tenders are to be submitted via the e-Submission application according to the instructions laid down in the Invitation to tender letter and the e-Submission Quick Guide. 

 Make sure you prepare and submit your electronic tender in e-Submission early enough to ensure it is received within the deadline specified under Heading IV.2.2 of the contract notice. A tender received after this deadline will be rejected. 

## **4.2 Content of the tender: what documents to submit with the tender?** 

The documents to be submitted with the tender in e-Submission are listed in **section 6** 

The following requirements apply to the technical and financial offer (to be uploaded as Technical tender and Financial tender in e-Submission): 

- • _Technical offer._ 

- a) The technical proposal of the Tenderer shall be in free format and in accordance with the page limitation instructions provided **.** The technical offer must provide all the information needed to assess the compliance with **section 1.4** of these specifications, the **Annex 1 “Technical Specifications”** and the award criteria. 

- b) The Minimum Requirements Checklist in **Annex 14 “Minimum requirements checklist”** must also be submitted in the technical offer. 

- • _Financial offer._ 

A complete financial offer, including the breakdown of the price needs to be uploaded. For this purpose, the Price Catalogue in **Annex 12 “Price Catalogue”** shall be completed, duly signed and uploaded in e-Submission. 

As part of the financial offer, tenderers must submit: 

- an electronic version of the Price Catalogue in the original electronic format (Microsoft Excel or equivalent); 

- a scanned copy of the entire Price Catalogue with all its worksheets; 

In case of doubt between the original electronic format and the scanned version of the financial model, the latter will prevail. 

Each tenderer’s financial offer must be completely unambiguous and unconditional. Tenders which contain statements preventing an accurate and complete comparison of the tenders (e.g. “To be discussed”, “Depending on x”, etc.) or referring to external circumstances (such as an already existing but separate contract) will be disqualified.
