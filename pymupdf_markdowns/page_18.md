FIG. 7: (color online) ∆ϕl(T ) vs. temperature for the surface
planes, l = 1 (triangles), l = 2 (squares), l = 3 (diamonds),
l = 4 (circles). Straight lines and full symbols: n = 8. Dashed
lines and open symbols: n = 16.


film leads to an effective 2d-like trend. Region ii) looks
however more intriguing, and requires a more accurate
discussion, which can benefit from a careful comparison
of the behaviour of a given quantity in regions i) and ii).

FIG. 9: ∆ϕl for a BCT lattice and n = 12, when the six
coupling constants set employed in Ref. 14,15 (see text) is
used. The temperature range has been chosen around TC(n)
(error bars lye within point size).
