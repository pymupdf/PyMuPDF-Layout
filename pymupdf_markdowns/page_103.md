# Risk Management

**Basic Approach**


As risks in the financial services increase in diversity and complexity,

risk management—identifying, measuring, and controlling risk—has

never been more important in the management of a financial holding

company.

SMFG has encapsulated the basic principles to be employed

in risk management in the manual entitled _Regulations on Risk_

_Management_ . In the manual, we have specified the basic policies

for risk management: 1) Set forth SMFG’s Groupwide basic policies

for risk management after specifying the categories of risk to which

these policies apply; 2) Provide all necessary guidance to Group

companies to enable them to follow the basic risk management

policies set forth by SMFG and set up their own appropriate risk

management systems; and 3) Monitor the implementation of risk

management by all Group companies to ensure that their practices

meet the relevant standards.


- **SMFG’s Risk Management System**



Under SMFG’s Groupwide basic policies for risk management,

all Group companies periodically carry out reviews of the basic

management policies for each risk category, or whenever deemed

necessary, thus ensuring that the policies followed at any time

are the most appropriate. The management of SMFG constantly

monitors the conduct of risk management at Group companies,

providing guidance when necessary.


**Risk Management System**

Top management plays an active role in determining SMFG’s

Groupwide basic policies for risk management. The system works

as follows: The basic policies for risk management are determined

by the Management Committee before being authorized by the

Board. The Management Committee, the designated board mem
bers, and the relevant risk management departments perform risk

management according to the basic policies.
