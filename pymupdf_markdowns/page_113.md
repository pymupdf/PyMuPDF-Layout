EXAMPLE 2 In a 250-ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.3 mole) of





25 Chemical Formula la, maleic anhydride (0.1 mole), **AIBN**
(0.8 g) and tetrahydrofuran ( 41 g) were placed, and the
mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon
atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was
completed, the polymers were precipitated from ethyl ether,



30 and dried in vacuo to obtain pure compound of Chemical
<Chemical Formula 7a> Formula 8 (yield: 80%).


**As** a polymerization initiator, conventional radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide may be used
instead of **AIBN** (yield: 40% ).

In a 100 ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.1 mole) of
Chemical Formula la, acrylic acid (0.06 mole), tetrahydrofuran (20 g) and AIBN (0.2 g) were placed, and the mixture
was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for
45
8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from distilled water or ethyl ether, to
obtain the compound of Chemical Formula 6 (yield: 60%).
