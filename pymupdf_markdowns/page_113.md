Polyacrolein thus obtained (20 g), ethane-1,2-diol (150 g), lb instead
toluene-p-sulfonic acid (1 g) and benzene (200 g) were
placed in a 1000-ml round-bottomed flask, and the reaction
was performed under reflux with a Dean and Stark water
separator attached to the flask, until no more water was 5
generated. After the reaction was completed, the product
was precipitated from distilled water, to obtain pure compound represented by following Chemical Formula 6a
(yield: 45%).

As the reaction catalyst, an acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or boron trifluoride-etherate 20
may be used instead of toluene-p-sulfonic acid. As a reaction
solvent, a non-carbonyl solvent such as tetrahydrofuran may
be used instead of benzene.

The procedure according to Example I was repeated but
using propane-1,2-diol (20 g) instead of ethane-1,2-diol, to
obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7a
(yield: 45%).

(0.8 g) and tetrahydrofuran ( 41 g) were placed, and the
mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon
atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was
completed, the polymers were precipitated from ethyl ether,

<Chemical Formula 7a> Formula 8 (yield: 80%).


**As** a polymerization initiator, conventional radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide may be used
instead of **AIBN** (yield: 40% ).
