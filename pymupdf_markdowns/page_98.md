# ENHANCING THE PORTFOLIO





In addition, an exploration

joint venture was formed with

ConocoPhillips in the NT/P61

block offshore Darwin, Northern

Territory, to drill the Caldita well

and provide Santos with access

rights to a potential expansion of

the Wickham Point LNG facility.

This deal further enhances Santos’

infrastructure strategy to leverage

its position within vital

infrastructure to improve

shareholder value while reducing

the risk profile of the wildcat

exploration program.


During the third quarter, Santos

expanded its offshore Victorian

gas interests to 50% in both the

Patricia-Baleen and the Sole gas

fields through the acquisition

from Trinity Gas Resources of an

additional 30% interest in the

Patricia-Baleen gas field and

associated processing facilities in

eastern Victoria and an additional

15% interest in the Sole gas field.


Santos earned its 30% additional

equity in the Patricia-Baleen gas

field by meeting Trinity’s

remaining share of drilling costs

on the Baleen 4 well which was

drilled successfully as a sidetrack

well of Baleen 3. Santos will earn

its 15% additional equity in the

Sole gas field by meeting certain

development costs on behalf of

Trinity, if and when the Sole joint

venture partners proceed to

develop this gas resource.



The acquisition of these Victorian

gas interests strengthens Santos’

domestic gas and infrastructure

strategy that was further

enhanced by the OMV purchase

announced early in 2005.

Importantly, Santos is now the

operator of the strategic Orbost

gas processing facility.


Late in the year, Santos sold its

18.02% share in the Carpentaria

Gas Pipeline between Ballera

and Mount Isa in Queensland

to Australian Pipeline Trust for

$59 million, resulting in a

$21 million after-tax profit

that was booked in the 2004

financial year.
