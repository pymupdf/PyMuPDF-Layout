**[0291]** Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably a photoacid generator including an anionic moiety and a cationic moiety from the viewpoint that the effect of the present invention is more excellent. 

**[0292]** More specifically, the photoacid generator is preferably a compound represented by General Formula **(ZI)** or General Formula **(ZII).** 

**[0293]** In General Formula **(ZI),** 

**[0294]** R 201 , R 202 , and R 203 each independently represent an organic group. 

**[0295]** The number of carbon atoms of the organic group as each of R 201 , R 202 , and R 203 is preferably **1** to 30, and more preferably **1** to 20. 

**[0296]** Furthermore, two ofR 201 to R 203 may be bonded to each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, an ester bond, an amide bond, or a carbonyl group, and examples of the group formed by the bonding of two of R 201 to R 203 include an alkylene group (for example, a butylene group and a pentylene group). 

> **[0297] z-** represents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion having a remarkably low ability of causing a nucleophilic reaction). 

**[0298]** Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a sulfonate anion (such as an aliphatic sulfonate anion, an aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an aromatic carboxylate anion, and an aralkyl carboxylate anion), a sulfonylimide anion, a bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide anion, and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion. 

**[0299]** The aliphatic moiety in the aliphatic sulfonate anion and the aliphatic carboxylate anion may be an alkyl group or a cycloalkyl group, and is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having **1** to 30 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 30 carbon atoms. 

**[0300]** As the aromatic ring group in the aromatic sulfonate anion and the aromatic carboxylate anion, an aryl group having 6 to **14** carbon atoms is preferable, and examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and a naphthyl group. 

**[0301]** Specific examples of the substituent which may be contained in the alkyl group, the cycloalkyl group, and the aryl group exemplified above include a nitro group, a halogen atom such as fluorine atom, a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a cyano group, an alkoxy group (preferably having **1** to 15 carbon atoms), a cycloalkyl group (preferably having 3 to 15 carbon atoms), an aryl group (preferably having 6 to **14** carbon atoms), an alkoxycarbonyl group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an acyl group (preferably having 2 to 12 carbon atoms), an alkoxycarbonyloxy group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an alkylthio group (preferably having **1** to 15 carbon atoms), an alkylsulfonyl group (preferably having **1** to 15 carbon atoms), an alkyliminosulfonyl group (preferably having **1** to 15 carbon atoms), an aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyl aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 7 to 20 carbon atoms), a cycloalkylaryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having **10** to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 5 to 20 carbon atoms), and a cycloalkylalkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 8 to 20 carbon atoms).
