more preferably **1** to 20.

**[0296]** Furthermore, two ofR201 to R203 may be bonded to
each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include
an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, an ester bond, an amide
bond, or a carbonyl group, and examples of the group
formed by the bonding of two of R201 to R203 include an
alkylene group (for example, a butylene group and a pentylene group).

**[0297]** **z-** represents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion having a remarkably low ability of causing a nucleophilic
reaction).

**[0298]** Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a
sulfonate anion (such as an aliphatic sulfonate anion, an
aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a
carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an
aromatic carboxylate anion, and an aralkyl carboxylate
anion), a sulfonylimide anion, a bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide
anion, and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion.

**[0299]** The aliphatic moiety in the aliphatic sulfonate
anion and the aliphatic carboxylate anion may be an alkyl
group or a cycloalkyl group, and is preferably a linear or
branched alkyl group having **1** to 30 carbon atoms or a
cycloalkyl group having 3 to 30 carbon atoms.

**[0300]** As the aromatic ring group in the aromatic sulfonate anion and the aromatic carboxylate anion, an aryl
group having 6 to **14** carbon atoms is preferable, and
examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and
a naphthyl group.




**[0291]** Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably
a photoacid generator including an anionic moiety and a
cationic moiety from the viewpoint that the effect of the
present invention is more excellent.


**[0292]** More specifically, the photoacid generator is preferably a compound represented by General Formula **(ZI)** or
General Formula **(ZII).**
