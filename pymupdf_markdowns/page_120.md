determining (404) whether the event is a userinitiated event or a software-initiated event;
if the event is a user-initiated event directly transitioning (406) the integrated circuit from the first
state of performance to the third state of performance based upon detecting the user event,
if the event is a software-initiated event transi
tioning (408) the integrated circuit from the first
state of performance to the second state of per
formance.

comprising instructions which, when executed by the
machine, cause the machine to perform the further
operations comprising:


changing an operating voltage level of the integrated circuit to change the state of performance
of the integrated circuit.


**26.** The machine-readable medium of claim 23, further
comprising instructions which, when executed by the
machine, cause the machine to perform the further
operations comprising:


operating the integrated circuit at the third state
of performance for a transient period of time.


**27.** The machine-readable medium of one of claims 23

to 26, further comprising instructions which, when
executed by the machine, cause the machine to perform the further operations comprising:
