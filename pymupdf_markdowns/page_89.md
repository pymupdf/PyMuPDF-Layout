**NEW TELEPHONE DIRECTORY FOR THE NORTHERN SHENANDOAH VALLEY**

# The Shenandoah Telephone Directory has undergone many changes

since we published our first directory in 1906, as The Farmers’ Mutual
Telephone System of Shenandoah County.  In 1906, the entire phone number
listings were on 15 pages. The first Company directory to include yellow
pages was distributed in 1946. That year local businesses invested in a new
way to reach their potential customers.


Early in 2003, we conducted a customer survey to measure potential
public acceptance of a regional phone directory for the six-county area. The
findings of the survey indicated almost 60% would likely use an expanded six-county directory, with a
fourth of all respondents saying they would use a regional directory more often than the directory they
currently had in their home or business. Based on these positive results, Shentel launched an expanded
directory to meet the demand.


An extensive public-awareness campaign was launched on television and radio, in a variety of daily and
weekly newspapers and at regional county fairs. The campaign helped build anticipation for the directory
and increase awareness of yellow page advertising opportunities. As a result of the added value of the
expanded distribution area, ShentelPages’ yellow page advertising revenues increased 21%, to $1.8 million
for the 2004 book.
