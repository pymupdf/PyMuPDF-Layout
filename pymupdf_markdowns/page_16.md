where R = 0.9 and Γ = {x|x1 = 0, x2 ≤ 0}. It is easy to see that system (5.69) is of the form (5.57) and


Φ(x1, x2) = x1 = 0. The system has a periodic solution


Ψµ(t) = (1 + (1 + µ) cos(t), −(1 + µ) sin(t)), (5.70)


where t ∈ R for µ ∈ (−2, 0].


The generating system of (5.69) has the following form


x [′] 1 [=][ x][2][,]



x [′] 2 [=][ −][0][.][0001[][x][2] 2 [+ (][x][1][ −] [1)][2][ −] [1]][x][2][ −] [x][1][ + 1][,]



(5.71)



∆x2|x∈Γ = −(1 + Rx2)x2,


and admits the periodic solution Ψ0(t) = (1+cos(t), − sin(t)). By means of the equality ⟨∇Φ(x [∗] ), f (x [∗] )⟩ =


⟨(1, 0), (0, 1)⟩ = 0 with x [∗] = (0, 0) ∈ ∂Γ, it is easy to say that x [∗] is a grazing point of Ψ0(t).


Let us start with the linearization of system (5.71) around the periodic solution Ψ0(t). Consider a


near solution y(t) = y(t, 0, y [∗] +∆y), where ∆y = (∆y1, ∆y2), to the periodic solution Ψ0(t). Assume that


y(t) satisfies condition (N 1), and it meets the surface of discontinuity Γ at the moment t = ξ and at the


point ¯y = y(ξ, 0, y [∗] + ∆y). Considering the formula (3.10) for the transversal point ¯y = (¯y1, ¯y2), the first
