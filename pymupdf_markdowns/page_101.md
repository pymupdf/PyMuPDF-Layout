**ACQUIRING NEW ACREAGE**

Future exploration success depends

on quality exploration acreage.

Santos acquired five exploration

blocks in three hydrocarbon

provinces during 2004. The most

significant of these were in Egypt

and Indonesia.


Egypt and surrounding countries

are a focus area for Santos. The

Company has farmed in to three

exploration blocks in Egypt with

US petroleum group, Devon

Energy, committing approximately

$70 million to an eight-well

exploration joint venture over

the next three years in the Gulf

of Suez. This is Santos’ first move

into the North Africa–Middle East

region, which is considered the

world’s premier hydrocarbon

province.


Santos continues to seek other

exploration opportunities in this

area, concentrating on the Gulf

of Suez and the onshore Desert

Basins.


Santos has acquired six

exploration permits in Indonesia

over the past three years,

including an interest in the

Donggala PSC in the Kutei Basin

during late 2004. This block lies

between Santos’ other Kutei

acreage: the Papalang and

Popodi PSCs.


The addition of the Donggala PSC

gives Santos a particularly strong

presence in the Kutei Basin and

covers a highly prospective trend,

while adding to the Company’s

growing Indonesian operations.


Other exploration acreage

portfolio management and

activities during 2004 included:


  - the award of exploration permit

T/36P in the Sorell Basin,

offshore Tasmania


16 Annual Report 2004




- the addition of three new

venture areas in the shallow

waters of the Gulf of Mexico

and onshore Montana and

Texas, which significantly

expands and diversifies the

US exploration acreage and

prospect inventory


- the farm-out of a 16.67%

interest in the WA-264-P

permit offshore Western

Australia to Beach Petroleum


- the farm-out of a 60% interest

and operatorship of the NT/P61

permit in the Bonaparte Basin,

offshore northern Australia to

ConocoPhillips


- the farm-out of a 70% interest

in the deep water exploration

block, Nth Bali 1 PSC, offshore

East Java Basin to Total

and Mitsui


- the farm-out of a 25%

interest in the VIC P/51

block containing the Callister

prospect to Mitsui & Co

subsidiary Mitwell Energy

Resources.


These farm-outs continued the

trend of risk-sharing with quality

partners.
