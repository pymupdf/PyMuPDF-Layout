[0291] Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably a photoacid generator including an anionic moiety and a cationic moiety from the viewpoint that the effect of the present invention is more excellent.

[0292] More specifically, the photoacid generator is preferably a compound represented by General Formula (ZI) or General Formula (ZII).

In General Formula (ZI),

[0294] R₍₂₀₁₎, R₍₂₀₂₎, and R₍₂₀₃₎ each independently represent an organic group.

[0295] The number of carbon atoms of the organic group as each of R₍₂₀₁₎, R₍₂₀₂₎, and R₍₂₀₃₎ is preferably 1 to 30, and more preferably 1 to 20.

[0296] Furthermore, two of R₍₂₀₁₎ to R₍₂₀₃₎ may be bonded to each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, an ester bond, an amide bond, or a carbonyl group, and examples of the group formed by the bonding of two of R₍₂₀₁₎ to R₍₂₀₃₎ include an alkylene group (for example, a butylene group and a pentylene group).

[0297] Z⁻ represents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion having a remarkably low ability of causing a nucleophilic reaction).

[0298] Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a sulfonate anion (such as an aliphatic sulfonate anion, an aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an aromatic carboxylate anion, and an aralkyl carboxylate anion), a sulfonylimide anion, a bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide anion, and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion.

[0299] The aliphatic moiety in the aliphatic sulfonate anion and the aliphatic carboxylate anion may be an alkyl group or a cycloalkyl group, and is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 30 carbon atoms.

[0300] As the aromatic ring group in the aromatic sulfonate anion and the aromatic carboxylate anion, an aryl group having 6 to 14 carbon atoms is preferable, and examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and a naphthyl group.

[0301] Specific examples of the substituent which may be contained in the alkyl group, the cycloalkyl group, and the aryl group exemplified above include:

* a nitro group,
* a halogen atom such as fluorine atom,
* a carboxyl group,
* a hydroxyl group,
* an amino group,
* a cyano group,
* an alkoxy group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms),
* a cycloalkyl group (preferably having 3 to 15 carbon atoms),
* an aryl group (preferably having 6 to 14 carbon atoms),
* an alkoxycarbonyl group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms),
* an acyl group (preferably having 2 to 12 carbon atoms),
* an alkoxycarbonyloxy group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms),
* an alkylthio group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms),
* an alkylsulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms),
* an alkyliminosulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms),
* an aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms),
* an alkyl aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 7 to 20 carbon atoms),
* a cycloalkylaryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 10 to 20 carbon atoms),
* an alkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 5 to 20 carbon atoms),
* a cycloalkylalkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 8 to 20 carbon atoms).

Where:

- \(R_{201}, R_{202}, R_{203}\) are organic groups (1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 20).
- Two of \(R_{201}\) to \(R_{203}\) may form a ring including oxygen, sulfur, ester, amide, or carbonyl groups.
- \(Z^-\) is a non-nucleophilic anion with low nucleophilic reactivity.
- Examples of \(Z^-\) include sulfonate, carboxylate, sulfonylimide, bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide, tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anions.
- Aliphatic moieties may be alkyl or cycloalkyl groups with specified carbon ranges.
- Aromatic moieties are aryl groups with 6 to 14 carbons, e.g., phenyl, tolyl, naphthyl.
- Substituents on these groups include nitro, halogen, carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, cyano, alkoxy, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkoxycarbonyl, acyl, alkoxycarbonyloxy, alkylthio, alkylsulfonyl, alkyliminosulfonyl, aryloxysulfonyl, alkyl aryloxysulfonyl, cycloalkylaryloxysulfonyl, alkyloxyalkyloxy, cycloalkylalkyloxyalkyloxy groups with preferred carbon atom ranges.
