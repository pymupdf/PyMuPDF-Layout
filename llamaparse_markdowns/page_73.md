Different courses have different registration fees. Please check the course fees list (`www.oxbridgeacademy.co.za/Documents/Price-list-2015.pdf`) to find out how much you need to pay to register for your chosen course, and pay this amount using the banking details provided at the bottom of the registration form. Remember to attach your proof of payment.

If you are under the age of 18, your parent or guardian will need to sign this section of the form to state that they are aware of your registration with Oxbridge Academy, and that they do not have any objections. If you are unemployed, you will need a guarantor to sign this section of the form. Your parent or guarantor will be held responsible if you miss any of your payments in relation to your course fees.
