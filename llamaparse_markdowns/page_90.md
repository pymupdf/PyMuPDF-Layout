## Short-Term Incentives

Effective from 1 July 2012, the Group implemented an STI Plan. The objectives of the STI Plan are to link the remuneration of certain executives to their performance and the performance of the Group. The Board set key performance measures and indicators for individual executives on an annual basis that reinforce the Group’s business plan and targets for the year.

Key features of the STI Plan are outlined in the following table.

### Overview of the STI Plan

| What is the STI plan and who participates?            | The STI Plan is a potential annual reward for eligible executive key management personnel for achievement of predetermined individual key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned to the achievement of business objectives for the assessment period (financial year commencing 1 July).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| What are the performance conditions?                  | For Key Management Personnel between 70% – 80% of potential STI weighting (dependent upon role) is assessed against specific predetermined KPIs by role with 20% – 30% being based on company performance indicators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| How are performance targets set and assessed?         | Individual performance targets are set by the identification of key achievements required by role in order to meet business objectives determined for the upcoming assessment period in advance. The criteria for Key Management Personnel are recommended by the Managing Director/CEO for sign off by the Remuneration Committee and in the case of the Managing Director/CEO, are recommended by the Chairman by sign off by the Remuneration Committee.<br/>The relative achievement at the end of the financial period is determined by the above authorities with final sign off by the Remuneration Committee after confirmation of financial results and individual/company performance against established criteria.<br/>The Remuneration Committee is responsible for assessing whether the KPIs are met. To assist in this assessment, the committee receives detailed reports on performance from management which are verified by independent remuneration consultants if required. The committee has the discretion to adjust STIs in light of unexpected or unintended circumstances. |
| How is the STI delivered?                             | STIs are paid in cash after the conclusion of the assessment period and confirmation of financial results/individual performance and subject to tax in accordance with prevailing Australian tax laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| What happens in the event of cessation of employment? | Unvested rights are forfeited on dismissal for cause. In all other termination circumstances any unvested rights granted in the year of the cessation of employment are forfeited in the proportion that the remainder of the year bears to a full year. Unvested rights that are not forfeited are retained by the participant and are subsequently tested for vesting at the end of the vesting period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
