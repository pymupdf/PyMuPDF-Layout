In case of discrepancies, only the amount indicated in the financial offer will be taken into account. The financial offer shall be:

* expressed in euro.cents. Tenderers from countries outside the euro zone have to quote their prices in euro as well. The price quoted may not be revised in line with exchange rate movements. It is for the tenderer to bear the risks or the benefits deriving from any variation.  
* quoted free of all duties, taxes and other charges, i.e. also free of VAT. The tenderer may indicate the amount of VAT but it must be shown separately.

> ☝ The European Union Institutions are exempt from such charges in the EU under Articles 3 and 4 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union of 8 April 1965 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Exemption is granted to the Commission by the governments of the Member States, either through refunds upon presentation of documentary evidence or by direct exemption.  
>  
> For those countries where national legislation provides an exemption by means of a reimbursement, the amount of VAT must be shown separately. In case of doubt about the applicable VAT system, it is the tenderer's responsibility to contact his or her national authorities to clarify the way in which the European Union is exempt from VAT.
