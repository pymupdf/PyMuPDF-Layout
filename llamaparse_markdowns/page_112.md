Also, the pattern forming method of the present invention comprises a step of exposing and developing the resist film above.

The composition of the present invention is typically used as follows. That is, the composition of the present invention is typically coated on a support such as substrate to form a film.

The thickness of the film is preferably from 0.02 to 0.1 µm. The method for coating the composition on a substrate is preferably spin coating, and the spinning speed is preferably from 1,000 to 3,000 rpm.

For example, the composition is coated on such a substrate (e.g., silicon/silicon dioxide-coated substrate, silicon nitride and chromium-deposited quartz substrate) as used in the production of a precision integrated circuit device, an imprint mold or the like, by using a spinner, a coater or the like. Thereafter, the coating is dried to obtain an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive film (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as a “resist film”). Incidentally, a known antireflection film may be previously provided by coating.

Subsequently, the resist film is irradiated with an actinic ray or radiation, then preferably baked (usually at 80 to 150° C., preferably at 90 to 130° C.), and developed. By performing baking, a more excellent pattern can be obtained.

Examples of the actinic ray or radiation include infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, far ultraviolet light, X-ray and electron beam. An actinic ray or radiation having, for example, a wavelength of 250 nm or less, particularly 220 nm or less, is preferred. Such an actinic ray or radiation includes, for example, KrF excimer laser (248 nm), ArF excimer laser (193 nm), F₂ excimer laser (157 nm), X-ray and electron beam. The actinic ray or radiation is preferably, for example, KrF excimer laser, electron beam, X-ray or EUV light, more preferably electron beam, X-ray or EUV light.

That is, the present invention also relates to an actinic ray-sensitive or radiation-sensitive resin composition for KrF excimer laser, electron beam, X-ray or EUV light (preferably electron beam, X-ray or EUV light).

In the development step, an alkali developer is usually used.

Examples of the alkali developer include an alkaline aqueous solution containing inorganic alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium metasilicate and aqueous ammonia, primary amines such as ethylamine and n-propylamine, secondary amines such as diethylamine and di-n-butylamine, tertiary amines such as triethylamine and methyldiethylamine, alcohol amines such as dimethylethanolamine and triethanolamine, quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide and tetraethylammonium hydroxide, or cyclic amines such as pyrrole and piperidine.

In the alkali developer, alcohols and a surfactant may be added in an appropriate amount.

The concentration of the alkali developer is usually from 0.1 to 20 mass %. The pH of the alkali developer is usually from 10.0 to 15.0.

Also, an imprint mold may be produced using the composition of the present invention.
