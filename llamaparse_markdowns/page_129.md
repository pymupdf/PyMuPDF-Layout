# Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

At December 31, 2004, there is a $6 million valuation allowance provided on certain New Jersey state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey state deferred tax assets because management believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition under SFAS 109. Management believes all other deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. Accordingly, there are no other valuation allowances provided at December 31, 2004.

The Company is evaluating the impact of provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) that provide for a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional guidance from Congress and/or the United States Treasury Department will be necessary for the Company to complete its evaluation, as it is not clear at this time whether the Act will provide a benefit to the Company. The Company will complete the evaluation as promptly as practicable following the issuance of such guidance and adjust taxes accordingly, if necessary.

The Company has not yet repatriated the net proceeds from the sale of MGM Grand Australia pending the evaluation. Nonetheless, the Company provided in 2004 deferred U.S. income taxes of $11 million on the basis that such proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of the 85 percent one-time deduction. Such amount was included in the provision for income taxes on discontinued operations for 2004. The Company considered the earnings of its Australia operations permanently reinvested prior to the sale of such operations.

If guidance is issued that indicates the planned repatriation qualifies for the one-time deduction, the Company will recognize a tax benefit of approximately $7 million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which such guidance is issued. If no such guidance is issued within the applicable timeframe, then the Company will attempt to permanently reinvest the proceeds in another foreign jurisdiction, such as Macau. In such case, the Company would recognize a tax benefit of $11 million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which the reinvestment is made. The Company currently does not have a plan to reinvest the proceeds in such manner.
