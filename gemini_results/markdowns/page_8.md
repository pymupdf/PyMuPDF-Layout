**Figure 4 (summary):** A log-linear plot showing the eigenvalues ($\lambda_i$) on the y-axis (ranging from 0.01 to 10) versus the Mode Number $i$ on the x-axis (ranging from 0 to 25). The curve shows a steep decline in eigenvalue magnitude for the first $\sim10$ modes, followed by a "kink" and a flattening out below $\lambda_i \approx 0.01$ for higher mode numbers, indicating a transition from signal-dominated to noise-dominated modes.

Before we invert $C_{ij}$ in Eqn. 12, we note that the values of $C_{ij}$ are estimated to limited resolution,

$$
\Delta C_{ij} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{N_{jk}}} \tag{14}
$$

and therefore, if $N_{jk}$ is small, or there are degeneracies within $C_{ij}$, the inversion will be affected. This problem can be eliminated by performing a Single Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix,

$$
C_{ij} = U^\dagger_{ik} D_{kl} V_{lj}, \tag{15}
$$

where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices that span the range and the null space of $C_{ij}$ and $D_{kl} = \lambda^2 \delta_{kl}$, a diagonal matrix with singular values along the diagonal. In doing the SVD, we select the dominant modes to contribute to the $\chi^2$ by requiring that $\lambda^2 > \sqrt{2/N_{jk}}$.

In Figure 4, we rank the eigenvalues ($\lambda_i$) for the increasing eigenmodes and see a "kink" in the distribution which we interpret as indicating a transition in the signal–to–noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the first ten modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered modes are dominated by noise. We therefore remove eigenmodes beyond this kink (with $\lambda_i < 0.01$) where the eigenvalues start to flatten out.

## A. Statistical determination of large scale flow

As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evidence for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalised $\Lambda$CDM model [18] and therefore, it is important to confirm these results as it may indicate evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity. In this paper, we provide a first demonstration of our new parameterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In detail, we attempt to model the "squashing" of the 2-D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical errors, due to a significant shot–noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger constraints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk flow measurements in the literature.

In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters $b$ and $v_p$ for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation between these two parameters because the anisotropic amplitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity fields. The best fit value from Figure 5 is $v_p = 270^{+433}$ km/s (at the $1\sigma$ level marginalised with other parameters including $b$) and is consistent with $v_p = 0$. We do not quote the negative bound of the error on $v_p$ as it is below zero and thus has no physical meaning. Instead, we quote the upper bound on $v_p$ and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of $v_p$ is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a WMAP5–normalised $\Lambda$CDM model.

We propose above that $v_p$ is a complementary parameter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter $g_\Theta$, which is equivalent to $f\sigma_8$, is not determined precisely without the prior information of $A_S$. But when we report our measurement with $v_p$, there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to $g^*_\Theta$ determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value $v_p$ at a given redshift is not only independent of bias but also independent of normalisation.

## B. Reconstruction of matter density field from $v_p$

We convert $v_p$ measurement into $g_\Theta$ using $A_S$ from WMAP5 ($g_\Theta$: coherent growth factor of peculiar velocity, and it is equivalent to $f\sigma_8$ in other parameterizations). With the evolution of $g_\Theta$ known, dynamics of perturbations are reconstructed to provide the history of $\Psi$ through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of $v_p$ is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample ($z \simeq 0.1$), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of $\Theta$ into the coherent evolution of $\Psi$. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coherent evolution of $\Phi$, $g_\Phi$.

We are able to determine matter density fluctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coherent growth of $\delta_m$, $g_\delta = 0.7$, which is related to $g_\Phi$ as
