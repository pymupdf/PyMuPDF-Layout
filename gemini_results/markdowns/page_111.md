![Chemical Structure: Continued repeating unit](placeholder-structure-continued.png)

**Structure (continued):** A repeating unit represented by Formula (Rx) containing a pendant fluorinated alcohol group (specifically a hexafluoroisopropanol moiety).

The polar group which may be possessed by the repeating unit having a polar group may be a carbonate group such as a cyclic carbonate ester structure, and the resin (A) preferably contain a repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure.

The repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure is preferably the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1).

![Formula (A-1)](placeholder-formula-A-1.png)

**Formula (A-1) (summary):** 
A polymer repeating unit where:
- The backbone is $-\ce{CH2}-\ce{C}(R_A^1)-$.
- A pendant group is attached via an ester linkage: $-\ce{C(=O)-O}-A-Z-(R_A^2)_n$.
- $Z$ represents a cyclic structure containing a carbonate group.

In Formula (A-1), $R_A^1$ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group.
If $n$ is 2 or more, $R_A^2$'s each independently represents a substituent.
$A$ represents a single bond or a divalent linking group.
$Z$ represents a atomic group forming a monocyclid or polycyclic structure together with a group represented by $-\ce{O-C(=O)-O}-$ in the formula.
$n$ represents an integer of 0 or more.

Formula (A-1) will be described in detail.

The alkyl group represented by $R_A^1$ may have a substituent such as a fluorine atom. $R_A^1$ represents preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluormethyl group, and more preferably a methyl group.

The substituent represented by $R_A^2$ is, for example, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxycarbonylamino group. The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, a straight alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group and a butyl group; and a branched alkyl group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. An alkyl group may have a substituent such as a hydroxyl group.

$n$ represents the number of substituents, and is an integer of 0 or more. For example, $n$ is preferably 0 to 4, and more preferably 0.

Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by $A$ may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond,

an urea bond, or combination thereof. Examples of the alkylene group may include preferably an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and for example a methylene group, an ethylene group, an propylene group, and the like.

In one aspect of the present invention, $A$ is preferably a single bond, or an alkylene group.

The moncyclic group containing $-\ce{O-C(=O)-O}-$, represented by $Z$ is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which $n_A=2$ to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a), and preferably a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring ($n_A=2$ or 3), and more preferably a 5-membered ring ($n_A=2$).

The polycyclic group containing $-\ce{O-C(=O)-O}-$ represented by $Z$ may, for example, be a structure in which a cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclid hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic ring.

![Formula (a)](placeholder-formula-a.png)

**Formula (a) (summary):** A generic cyclic carbonate ring structure where $n_A$ denotes the number of methylene groups in the ring (in addition to the carbonate linkage).

The monomer corresponding to the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be synthesized by a conventionally known method described in, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 32 p. 3741(1986), Organic Letters, Vol. 4, No. 15 p. 2561(2002), and the like.

In the resin (A), the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be contained either alone or in a combination of two or more thereof.

Hereinafter, specific examples of the repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto.

In addition, $R_A^1$ in the following specific examples has the same meaning as $R_A^1$ in Formula (A-1).

![Specific Examples of Repeating Units](placeholder-specific-examples.png)

**Specific Examples (summary):**
- **Left structure:** A methacrylate repeating unit with a pendant group consisting of an ethylene glycol spacer attached to a 5-membered cyclic carbonate (2-oxo-1,3-dioxolane-4-yl)methyl group.
- **Right structure:** A methacrylate repeating unit with a pendant group consisting of a methylene spacer attached to a 6-membered cyclic carbonate ring (specifically a 2-oxo-1,3-dioxane derivative).
