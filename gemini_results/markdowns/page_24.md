**Figure S1 (summary):**
- **Panel A:** A plot of Probability Density versus Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed). It displays four bell-shaped curves corresponding to values 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. The distributions are shifted along the x-axis but maintain similar widths (variances).
- **Panel B:** A scatter plot of Standard deviation of dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) versus Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed). The data points form a dense cloud centered roughly around 0 on the x-axis, indicating no strong linear relationship.

**Figure S1:** We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

**Figure S2 (summary):**
- **Panel A:** A scatter plot of Fisher Percentiles versus Pearson Percentiles showing a perfect diagonal line with the annotation $r=0.9999$.
- **Panel B:** A scatter plot of Mean dynamic FC versus Static FC. The red regression line indicates a strong positive correlation, annotated with $r=0.97$.

**Figure S2:** Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is $r \approx 1$. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
