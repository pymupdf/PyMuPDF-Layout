# EAGLE FORD

The Eagle Ford continues to have one of the highest internal rates of return of any of the US unconventional resource plays.

Because of its relatively low operating costs, the Eagle Ford remains profitable during current oil commodity pricing conditions. Sundance has quickly transformed the Eagle Ford position acquired in its merger with Texon Petroleum Ltd to its most valuable asset in its portfolio through development and growing its drilling inventory.

In 2014, the Company brought 35 gross (26.1 net) Eagle Ford wells into production by D&P investments of \$244 million. Through \$26 million of direct mineral leases and \$36 million of acquisitions in 2014, the Company increased its Eagle Ford acreage position to 20,742 net acres, which represents 153.7 net undrilled 3P Reserves locations.

Since its entrance into the Eagle Ford in March 2013, the Company has:

*   increased its production over 10x to a 2014 exit rate of 8,177 BOEPD (a 290 percent CAGR);
*   increased 1P Constant Case Reserves by 10x to 18,132 MBOE (PV10 of \$449.3 million (an 18x increase));
*   increased its acreage to approximately 33,000 net acres, primarily in the volatile oil and condensate window of the Eagle Ford (includes 14,180 net acres acquired in January 2015 and excludes 5,418 net acres targeting the Georgetown Formation in neighboring Maverick County);
*   increased its producing well count to 77 gross (53.8 net), with an additional 19 gross (10.6 net) wells in progress at year-end;
*   increased its undrilled 3P Reserves drilling locations to 153.7 net; which represents a 4.3 year drilling inventory (assuming two rig program drilling 36 net wells per year and 40-80 acre spacing).
