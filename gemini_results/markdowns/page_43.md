# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be indicated only once within the identification box. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio aids.

**Figure 1 (Summary):** An annotated diagram of a VORTAC box (Example: PONTIAC). It highlights the following elements:
*   **Frequency:** 111.0 (Underline indicates no voice).
*   **TACAN Channel:** Ch 47.
*   **Identifier:** PTK.
*   **FSS Radio Frequencies:** 122.1R, 123.6 positioned above the box.
*   **Operational Notes:** "Operates less than continuous or on-request".
*   **Visual cues:** Crosshatch on the box indicates Shutdown status.

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

**Figure 2 (Summary):** A compass rose surrounding a data box for "VOR SALEM" (114.3 SVM). The diagram points to an open circle symbol inside the rose, noting: "Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport. Type of NAVAID shown in top of box."

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or "DME" (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

# AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section).

### Public use airports:

*   **[Icon: Blue outline with tick marks]** Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069’ or some multiple runways less than 8069’
*   **[Icon: Magenta circle with white X]** Hard-surfaced runways 1500’ to 8069’
*   **[Icon: Magenta open circle]** Other than hard-surfaced runways
*   **[Icon: Anchor]** Seaplane bases

### Military airports:

*   **[Icon: Double circle/Bullseye]** Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as **AAF** (Army Air Field), **AFB** (Air Force Base), **MCAS** (Marine Corps Air Station), **NAS** (Naval Air Station), **NAV** (Naval Air Facility), **NAAS** (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation **DND** (Department of National Defense).

### Fuel Available:

![Icon: Airport symbol with tick marks](fuel-symbol.png)

Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.

### Other airports with or without fuel:

![Icons: Various circular airport symbols](other-airport-icons.png)

**Figure 3 (Summary):** Five circular icons containing letters or symbols:
1.  Circle with **H**
2.  Circle with **F**
3.  Circle with **U**
4.  Circle with **R**
5.  Circle with a cross/X inside (Abandonment/Closed symbol)
