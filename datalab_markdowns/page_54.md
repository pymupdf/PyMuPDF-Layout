## **2.4 Ways to submit a tender: how can economic operators organise themselves to submit a tender?**

Economic operators can submit a tender either as a sole tenderer or as a group of tenderers. In either case subcontracting is permitted.

In order to fulfil the selection criteria, as set out in **section 3.2,** the tenderer can rely on the capacities of subcontractors or other entities (that are not subcontractors).

The role of each entity involved in a tender (hereafter referred to as "the involved entity") must be clearly specified in the e-Submission application: i) sole tenderer, ii) group leader of a group of tenderers, iii) member of a group of tenderers, or iv) subcontractor. For an entity on whose capacities the tenderer relies to fulfil the selection criteria (that is not a subcontractor), this role is defined in the commitment letter (**Annex 07**). This applies also where the involved entities belong to the same economic group.

In particular, the tenderer must provide a detailed overview of all companies involved in the tender; clearly describing how the work will be distributed (share and exact distribution of responsibilities) and explaining from which location the different services will be delivered.

## **2.4.1. Joint tenders**

A joint tender is a situation where a tender is submitted by a group (with or without legal form) of economic operators regardless of the link they have between them. The group as a whole is considered a tenderer<sup>9</sup> .

All members of the group assume joint and several liability towards the *Contracting Authority* for the performance of the contract as a whole.

Group members must appoint a *Group Leader* and a single point of contact authorised to act on their behalf in connection with the submission of the tender and all relevant questions, clarification requests, notifications, etc., that may be received during the evaluation, award and until the contact signature. The model power of attorney attached in **Annex 04 "Power of Attorney"** is to be used.

The joint tender must clearly indicate the role and tasks of each member and of the *Group Leader* who will act as the *Contracting Authority*'s contact point for the contract's administrative or financial aspects and operational management. The *Group Leader* will have full authority to bind the group and each of its members during contract execution. If the joint tender is successful, the *Contracting Authority* shall sign the contract with the Group Leader, authorized by the other members to sign the contract on their behalf via power of attorney drawn up in the model attached in **Annex 04 "Power of Attorney"**.

Changes in the composition of the group during the procurement procedure (after the submission deadline and before contract signature) shall lead to rejection of the tender except in case of:
