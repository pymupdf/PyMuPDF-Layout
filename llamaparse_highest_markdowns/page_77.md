Now choose any cell in this table and choose Pivot Table wizard in the Data menu. Excel asks for the data source and suggests this table. Click OK.

The Excel interface shows the Insert tab with various options including:
- PivotTable
- Table  
- Picture
- Clip Art
- Shapes
- SmartArt
- Column
- Line
- Pie

Under Tables and Illustrations sections.

A sample data table is visible with columns:
- Name of Worker
- Week
- Nature of Payment  
- Amount

Sample data includes:
- X, 1, Washing Allowance, 25
- Y, 1, Conveyance Expenses, 30

The Insert PivotTable dialog appears with the description: "Click here to summarize data using a PivotTable or to insert a PivotChart. PivotTables make it easy to arrange and summarize complicated data and drill down on details."

The Create PivotTable dialog box shows:

**Choose the data that you want to analyze:**
- ○ Select a table or range
  - Table/Range: Sheet1!$A$2:$D$50
- ○ Use an external data source
  - Choose Connection...
  - Connection name:

**Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be placed:**
- ● New Worksheet
- ○ Existing Worksheet
  - Location: [blank field]

[OK] [Cancel]

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than A1:D50, you may want to specify $A$1:$D$500.

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.
