| Shows probability density curves for four different levels of static functional connectivity (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0) plotted against Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed) ranging from -1 to 3. The curves show similar variances despite different static connectivity magnitudes. | Scatter plot showing the relationship between Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) on x-axis (-1 to 3) and St dev dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed) on y-axis (0.1 to 0.7). Points are densely clustered showing no systematic relationship. |


**Figure S1:** We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

| Linear correlation plot showing Fisher Percentiles (y-axis, 0.0 to 1.0) vs Pearson Percentiles (x-axis, 0.0 to 1.0) with perfect linear relationship, r=0.9999 | Scatter plot showing Static FC (x-axis, -2 to +2) vs Mean dynamic FC (y-axis, -2 to +2) with strong positive correlation, r=0.97 |


**Figure S2:** Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is r ≈ 1. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
