film leads to an effective 2d-like trend. Region ii) looks however more intriguing, and requires a more accurate discussion, which can benefit from a careful comparison of the behaviour of a given quantity in regions i) and ii).

For this purpose, we look at the temperature dependence of the rotation angle of the magnetization between NN planes. In Fig. 7, Δφ<sub>l</sub>(T) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1...4. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature T ≲ T<sub>N</sub>(8), an abrupt drop of Δφ<sub>3</sub> and Δφ<sub>4</sub>, which rapidly reach an almost constant value, only slightly larger than Δφ<sub>1</sub>. In the temperature range T<sub>N</sub>(8) ≲ T < T<sub>C</sub>(8) we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all NN layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-FM configuration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position Q<sub>z,max</sub> of the structure factor S(0, 0, q<sub>z</sub>). In Fig. 8 the average of Q<sub>z,max</sub> vs T is reported, again for n = 8 and for different lateral dimensions L<sup>26</sup>. As expected from the previous argument, we see that Q<sub>z,max</sub> = 0 for T<sub>N</sub>(8) < T < T<sub>C</sub>(8), while it begins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below T<sub>N</sub>(8), making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with Q<sub>z,max</sub> ≠ 0 and reaching a value of about 21° for T = 10 K.

FIG. 9: Δφ<sub>l</sub> for a BCT lattice and n = 12, when the six coupling constants set employed in Ref. 14,15 (see text) is used. The temperature range has been chosen around T<sub>C</sub>(n) (error bars lye within point size).

In a previous study, where the magnetic properties of Ho thin films were investigated by MC simulations of a Heisenberg model with easy-plane single-ion anisotropy and six out-of-plane coupling constants (as obtained by experimental neutron scattering measurements<sup>16</sup>) on a HCP lattice<sup>14,15</sup>, it was found that for thicknesses comparable with the helical pitch the phase diagram landscape is quite different from what we find here. Indeed, for n = 9 − 16, three different magnetic phases could be singled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layers blocks coexist with some inner disordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the signatures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one.

The absence of the block phase in the J<sub>1</sub> − J<sub>2</sub> model here investigated has to be attributed to the different range of interactions, rather than to the different lattice structure. We came to this conclusion by doing some simulations using the same set of interaction constants employed in Refs. 14,15, but using a BCT lattice: the results we obtained for Δφ<sub>l</sub> with n = 12 are reported in Fig. 9. The latter is absolutely similar to Fig.7 of Ref. 15 and clearly displays the footmarks of the block phase (see down-triangle), with two external blocks of ordered layers (l =1...5 and 8...12), where Δφ<sub>l</sub> is roughly 10°, separated by a block of disordered layers, and with almost
