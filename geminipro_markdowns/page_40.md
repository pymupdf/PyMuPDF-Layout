**Figure 1 (summary):** An example aeronautical chart segment illustrating a missed approach path, including various waypoints (OPNIC, BOULD, LEEBR), obstacles with altitudes, and an inset map showing local roads (I-70, I-65, etc.).

# MISSED APPROACH INFORMATION

Missed approach information is shown in 3 locations on the chart:

*   **The Middle Briefing Strip** - The complete textual missed approach instructions are provided at the top of the approach chart in the middle pilot briefing strip.
*   **The Planview** - The missed approach track is drawn using a thin, hash marked line with a directional arrow. If the missed approach fix is off the chart, the missed approach track shall extend to the chart border.
*   **The Profile Box** - Missed Approach Icons will be depicted in the upper left or upper right of the profile box. The Missed Approach Icons are intended to provide quick, at a glance intuitive guidance to the pilot, to supplement the textual missed approach instructions in the briefing strip. Space permitting, all textual missed approach instructions will be graphically depicted in sequence. If space does not permit the depiction of all missed approach icons, only the first four icon boxes will be shown.

## Example Missed Approach Icons

| Example Missed Approach Icons | Missed Approach Text |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Icon]** A vertical arrow indicating a climb to 13000 on RIL R-250 to TEKGU INT, then proceeding to WOKPA. | MISSED APPROACH: Climb to 13000 on RIL VOR/DME R-250 to TEKGU INT/RIL 19 DME and on EKR VOR/DME R-179 to WOKPA/EKR 44.2 DME and hold, continue climb-in-hold to 13000. |
| **[Icon]** A curving arrow indicating a climbing left turn to 8000 on SVC R-128, followed by a reverse course icon. | MISSED APPROACH: Climbing left turn to 8000 via SVC R-128, then reverse course to SVC VOR/DME and hold. |
| **[Icon]** A sequence of icons: climb to 9000, track 112° to JETRY (cross at or above 6700), track 112° to PAKPE, right turn to WULKU, track 289° to JNC, and hold. | MISSED APPROACH: Climb to 9000 on track 112° to JETRY, cross JETRY at or above 6700, and on track 112° to PAKPE, right turn to WULKU, and on track 289° to JNC VOR/DME and hold. |
