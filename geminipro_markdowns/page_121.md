![Chemical Structure P-54](placeholder-p54.png)

**Chemical Structure P-54 (Summary):**
A copolymer structure consisting of two repeating units:
1.  **Left Unit:** A polystyrene-derivative backbone where the phenyl ring is substituted at the para-position with an oxygen atom connected to a sulfonyl group chain containing fluorine atoms and a sulfonimide anion ($-\text{SO}_2-\text{N}^--\text{SO}_2-$). This anionic site is paired with a bulky sulfonium cation counter-ion featuring three aromatic rings (one bearing a methoxy group, another bearing a phenylthio group).
2.  **Right Unit:** A methacrylate backbone unit with an ester side chain attached to a biphenyl group.

**Chemical Structure P-55 (Summary):**
A copolymer structure consisting of two repeating units:
1.  **Left Unit:** A polystyrene-derivative backbone where the phenyl ring is attached via an oxygen to a fluorinated sulfonyl chain ending in a sulfonate anion ($-\text{SO}_3^-$). This is paired with a similar sulfonium cation as seen in P-54.
2.  **Right Unit:** A methacrylate backbone unit with a bulky, fused tricyclic hydrocarbon ester side chain (appearing to be a saturated naphthyl or similar alicyclic derivative).

## <Other Components>

**[0317]** The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are described below.

### (Photo-Acid Generator)

**[0318]** The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

**[0319]** The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

**[0320]** Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae (ZI), (ZII) and (ZIII):
