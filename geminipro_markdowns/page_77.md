**Figure (summary):** An Excel screenshot showing the "Insert" tab with the "PivotTable" option highlighted. The "Create PivotTable" dialog box is open, showing that the data source is selected as the range `Sheet1!$A$2:$D$50` and the destination for the PivotTable report is a "New Worksheet".

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in the above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than `A1:D50`, you may want to specify `$A$1:$D$500`.

One more suggestion is, as shown in the Graphic, you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.
