**Figure Summary:**
The image displays the Microsoft Excel interface. 
1.  The **Insert** tab is active on the ribbon, showing the **PivotTable** button on the far left.
2.  A dialog box titled **Create PivotTable** is open overlaying a spreadsheet. 
    - The option "Select a table or range" is chosen.
    - The "Table/Range" field is populated with `Sheet1!$A$2:$D$50`.
    - The background spreadsheet shows columns for "Name of Worker", "Week", "Nature of Payment", and "Amount".

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than `A1:D50`, you may want to specify `$A$1:$D$500`.

**Figure Summary:**
A close-up of the lower section of the **Create PivotTable** dialog box. A red rectangle highlights the section "Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be placed," showing options for:
- New Worksheet (Selected)
- Existing Worksheet

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.
