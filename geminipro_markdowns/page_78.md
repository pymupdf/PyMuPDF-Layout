**Figure 8-39 (summary):** A dialog box titled "Import Mappings". It has a dropdown menu labeled "Select Source Host:" with "ITSO-VMHOST-" selected, and two buttons: "Cancel" and "Import".

3. After the task completes, verify that the mappings are as expected from the **Hosts** menu (see Figure 8-26 on page 346), right-click the target host, and select **Properties**. Then, click the **Mapped Volumes** tab and verify that the required volumes were mapped to the new host (see Figure 8-37 on page 353).
