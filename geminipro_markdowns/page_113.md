Polyacrolein thus obtained (20 g), ethane-1,2-diol (150 g), toluene-p-sulfonic acid (1 g) and benzene (200 g) were placed in a 1000-ml round-bottomed flask, and the reaction was performed under reflux with a Dean and Stark water separator attached to the flask, until no more water was generated. After the reaction was completed, the product was precipitated from distilled water, to obtain pure compound represented by following Chemical Formula 6a (yield: 45%).

**Figure (Chemical Formula 6a) summary:** A chemical structure of a homopolymer, poly(2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane). The repeating unit is labeled with the subscript 'a'.

As the reaction catalyst, an acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or boron trifluoride-etherate may be used instead of toluene-p-sulfonic acid. As a reaction solvent, a non-carbonyl solvent such as tetrahydrofuran may be used instead of benzene.

## EXAMPLE 2

The procedure according to Example 1 was repeated but using propane-1,2-diol (20 g) instead of ethane-1,2-diol, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7a (yield: 45%).

## EXAMPLE 3

In a 100 ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.1 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, acrylic acid (0.06 mole), tetrahydrofuran (20 g) and AIBN (0.2 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from distilled water or ethyl ether, to obtain the compound of Chemical Formula 6 (yield: 60%).

## EXAMPLE 5

In a 250-ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.3 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, maleic anhydride (0.1 mole), AIBN (0.8 g) and tetrahydrofuran (41 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from ethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to obtain pure compound of Chemical Formula 8 (yield: 80%).

As a polymerization initiator, conventional radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide may be used instead of AIBN (yield: 40%).
