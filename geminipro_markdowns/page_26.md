# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION (Continued)

## Stand Alone Flight Services and Communication Outlets

### Flight Service Station (FSS)

Shadow NAVAID boxes indicate Flight Service Station (FSS) locations. Frequencies 122.2 and 255.4 (Conterminous U.S.); 121.5, 122.2, 243.0 and 255.4 (Alaska); and 121.5, 126.7, and 243.0 (Canada) are available at many FSSs and are not shown. All other frequencies are shown above the box.

Certain FSSs provide Local Airport Advisory (LAA) on 123.6.

Frequencies transmit and receive except those followed by R and T:

*   **R** - Receive Only
*   **T** - Transmit Only

### Remote Communications Outlet (RCO)

Thin line NAVAID boxes without frequencies and controlling FSS name indicate no FSS frequencies available. Frequencies positioned above the thin line boxes are remoted to the NAVAID sites. Other frequencies at the controlling FSS named are available, however altitude and terrain may determine their reception.

In Canada, a "D" after the frequency indicates a dial-up remote communications outlet.
