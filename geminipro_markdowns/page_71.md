By right-clicking and selecting **Properties**, you see detailed technical parameters, such as ID, state (online or offline), drive capacity, and the drive use, as shown in Figure 5-30.

**Figure 5-30 (summary):** A two-step process is shown.
1.  In a "Rear View" diagram of a system, a user right-clicks a component labeled "Node Canister", which opens a context menu.
2.  The user selects "Properties" from the menu, which opens a "Properties for Canister 1" window. This window displays technical details such as:
    *   **Controller:** 1
    *   **Configuration node:** Yes
    *   **WWNN:** 500507680B007610
    *   **Memory:** 32 GiB
    *   **CPU:** 10 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2618L v4 @ 2.20GHz
    *   **FRU PN:** 0000000
    *   **FRU identity:** 11S0000000Y000000000000

In an environment with multiple IBM Storwize V7000 clusters, you can easily direct the onsite personnel or technician to the correct device by enabling the identification LED on the front pane. Click **Turn Identify On** in the menu that is shown in Figure 5-31.

**Figure 5-31 (summary):** The image shows a "Front View" of a storage device with multiple drive bays. A user clicks "Turn Identify On" from a menu associated with one of the drives. An arrow points to the same view, but now an indicator light (LED) on that specific drive is illuminated, physically identifying it.

Wait for confirmation from the technician that the device in the data center was correctly identified. In the GUI, you see a flashing light, which indicates that the Identify LED was turned on.
