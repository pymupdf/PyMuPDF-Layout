**Figure 5-30 (summary):**
The interface shows a "Rear View" of a hardware component.
1.  A context menu is displayed (triggered by a "right-click" arrow) with the **Properties** option highlighted.
2.  A dialog box titled "Properties for Canister 1" is open. It displays technical details including:
    *   **Canister:** [Visual status bar]
    *   **Controller:** 1
    *   **Configuration node:** Yes
    *   **WWNN:** 500507680B007610
    *   **Memory:** 32 GiB
    *   **CPU:** 10 core Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2618L v4 @ 2.20GHz
    *   **FRU PN:** 0000000
    *   **FRU identity:** 11S0000000Y00000000000

In an environment with multiple IBM Storwize V7000 clusters, you can easily direct the onsite personnel or technician to the correct device by enabling the identification LED on the front pane. Click **Turn Identify On** in the menu that is shown in Figure 5-31.

**Figure 5-31 (summary):**
The figure illustrates the process of identifying a drive:
*   **Left (Rear View):** A context menu is open with the option **Turn Identify On** highlighted.
*   **Right (Front View):** A red arrow points from the menu to a representation of the front of the chassis, where a specific drive slot is visually highlighted, simulating the identification LED activation.

Wait for confirmation from the technician that the device in the data center was correctly identified. In the GUI, you see a flashing light, which indicates that the Identify LED was turned on.
