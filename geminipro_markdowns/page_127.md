![Figure: Example chemical structures](placeholder-structures.png)

**Figure (summary):** A series of six specific chemical structures are shown, labeled `350A³`, `311A³`, `250A³`, `535A³`, `290A³`, and `315A³`. These molecules are examples of non-nucleophilic anions, which are components of photoacid generators. They generally feature:
*   A sulfonic acid group ($\ce{HO3S-}$) or a derivative.
*   A perfluoroalkyl chain (e.g., `-CF2-CF2-`).
*   A sulfonyl ($\ce{-SO2-}$) or sulfonamide ($\ce{-SO2NH-}$) group linking the fluorinated chain to another moiety.
*   Various terminal groups, including cyclic structures like decahydronaphthalene, indole, adamantane, and substituted phenyl rings. For instance, structure `290A³` is an adamantyl ester derivative, and `535A³` is a sulfonate ester of a substituted phenol.

[0291] Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably a photoacid generator including an anionic moiety and a cationic moiety from the viewpoint that the effect of the present invention is more excellent.

[0292] More specifically, the photoacid generator is preferably a compound represented by General Formula (ZI) or General Formula (ZII).

[0293] In General Formula (ZI),

[0294] R201, R202, and R203 each independently represent an organic group.

[0295] The number of carbon atoms of the organic group as each of R201, R202, and R203 is preferably 1 to 30, and more preferably 1 to 20.

[0296] Furthermore, two of R201 to R203 may be bonded to each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, an ester bond, an amide bond, or a carbonyl group, and examples of the group formed by the bonding of two of R201 to R203 include an alkylene group (for example, a butylene group and a pentylene group).

[0297] $Z^-$ represents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion having a remarkably low ability of causing a nucleophilic reaction).

[0298] Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a sulfonate anion (such as an aliphatic sulfonate anion, an aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an aromatic carboxylate anion, and an aralkyl carboxylate anion), a sulfonylimide anion, a bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide anion, and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion.

[0299] The aliphatic moiety in the aliphatic sulfonate anion and the aliphatic carboxylate anion may be an alkyl group or a cycloalkyl group, and is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 30 carbon atoms.

[0300] As the aromatic ring group in the aromatic sulfonate anion and the aromatic carboxylate anion, an aryl group having 6 to 14 carbon atoms is preferable, and examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and a naphthyl group.

[0301] Specific examples of the substituent which may be contained in the alkyl group, the cycloalkyl group, and the aryl group exemplified above include a nitro group, a halogen atom such as fluorine atom, a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a cyano group, an alkoxy group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), a cycloalkyl group (preferably having 3 to 15 carbon atoms), an aryl group (preferably having 6 to 14 carbon atoms), an alkoxycarbonyl group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an acyl group (preferably having 2 to 12 carbon atoms), an alkoxycarbonyloxy group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an alkylthio group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an alkylsulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an alkyliminosulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyl aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 7 to 20 carbon atoms), a cycloalkylaryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 10 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 5 to 20 carbon atoms), and a cycloalkylalkyloxyalkyloxy group (preferably having 8 to 20 carbon atoms).
