1.  The Oklahoma US state tax jurisdiction computes income taxes on a direct accounting basis. A significant portion of the 2014 impairment related to this jurisdiction resulting in a deferred tax benefit of $3,044 creating deferred tax assets, of which $2,064 were unrecognized.

2.  The change in apportioned state tax rates in US controlled entities is a result of the Company disposing of its property in Colorado (income tax rate of 4.63%) (2013: North Dakota with income tax rate of 4.53%) through a tax deferred sale and reinvesting the property in Texas (margin tax rate of 1%). As the Texas margin tax computation is similar in nature to an income tax computation, it is treated as an income tax for financial reporting purposes.

3.  This income tax benefit results from the election to consolidate certain Australian subsidiaries for income tax purposes effective 1 January 2014, making previously unrecognized deferred tax assets of one of these Australian subsidiaries available for utilization against future income of the consolidated Australian entities. These deferred tax assets were previously unrecognized due to the lack of evidence of future taxable income for these Australian subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis.
