# NEW TELEPHONE DIRECTORY FOR THE NORTHERN SHENANDOAH VALLEY

The Shenandoah Telephone Directory has undergone many changes since we published our first directory in 1906, as The Farmers' Mutual Telephone System of Shenandoah County. In 1906, the entire phone number listings were on 15 pages. The first Company directory to include yellow pages was distributed in 1946. That year local businesses invested in a new way to reach their potential customers.

The goal has always been to provide a useful tool for our customers. The pace of change has quickened in the last few years. In 2000, for the first time, Shenandoah Telephone's directory expanded from telephone listings for only Shenandoah County and Bergton, to include business and residential listings for Rockingham, Frederick, Clarke, and Warren counties. In 2001, Page County listings were added. The name of our directory was changed to ShentelPages in 2002 to reflect the expanded listing area. Although we included additional information in our directory, we continued to only furnish it to our local telephone customers.

Early in 2003, we conducted a customer survey to measure potential public acceptance of a regional phone directory for the six-county area. The findings of the survey indicated almost 60% would likely use an expanded six-county directory, with a fourth of all respondents saying they would use a regional directory more often than the directory they currently had in their home or business. Based on these positive results, Shentel launched an expanded directory to meet the demand.

An extensive public-awareness campaign was launched on television and radio, in a variety of daily and weekly newspapers and at regional county fairs. The campaign helped build anticipation for the directory and increase awareness of yellow page advertising opportunities. As a result of the added value of the expanded distribution area, ShentelPages' yellow page advertising revenues increased 21%, to $1.8 million for the 2004 book.

In December 2003, Shentel mailed out 120,000 ShentelPages directories to every home and business in Shenandoah, Rockingham, Frederick, Page, Clarke and Warren counties. ShentelPages now has a potential audience that exceeds 300,000 readers. The 2004 directory continues to be an important local resource. In addition to telephone listings, it contains both general and county-specific information - from ZIP codes to area codes, and from international dialing instructions to the listing of regional interstate exits.

Through ShentelPages, businesses have a new way of reaching thousands more potential customers within the six-county area to sell their products and services. ShentelPages is bundled with our electronic version, ShentelPages.com. This service allows area residents to use their computer and the Internet to let their fingers do the walking.

Just like our first book in 1906, the 2004 ShentelPages provides area residents with a quick and easy way to stay in touch.
