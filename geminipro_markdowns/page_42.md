**Figure (summary):** This figure illustrates Class B airspace. On the left is a simplified diagram showing the general shape of Class B airspace with a 30 NM Mode C ring around Salt Lake City Intl (SLC) and South Valley Rgnl (U42) airports. On the right is a detailed example from an FAA IFR Enroute Chart showing complex airways (e.g., V32, V200), navigational aids, airports, and altitude restrictions in the vicinity of Salt Lake City. A note on the chart indicates to see the Salt Lake City VFR Terminal Area Chart for specific Class B details.
