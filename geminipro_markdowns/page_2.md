**Abstract**

Substantial progress are reported on field effect transistors (FET) consisting of semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) without detectable traces of metallic nanotubes and impurities. This outstanding result was made possible in particular by ultracentrifugation ($250,000g$) of solutions composed of SWNT powders with polyfluorene as extracting agent in toluene. Such s-SWNTs processable solutions were applied to realize FET, embodying randomly or preferentially oriented nanotube networks prepared by spin coating or dielectrophoresis. Devices exhibit a stable p-type semiconductor behavior in air with very promising characteristics: the on-off current ratio is $10^5$, the on-current level is around $10 \, \mu\text{A}$ and the estimated hole mobility is larger than $2 \, \text{cm}^2/\text{Vs}$. The present results are demonstrated by optical absorption, Raman and electrical measurements.

Novel semiconductors materials for field effect transistor FET and thin-film transistors TFT are highly demanded [1]. In particular, semiconducting single wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) are very promising, because individual s-SWNTs are known to exhibit high on-off current ratio, high electron/hole mobility, to carry high current density and to operate at high frequencies [2–5]. Several groups have demonstrated excellent transfer characteristics using individual s-SWNTs [2–5], but generally poor ones using ensemble (network and thin film) of SWNTs due to traces of metallic nanotubes (m-SWNTs) and impurities (catalytic and amorphous particles) [6–8]. Therefore, very efficient methods to selectively synthesis s-SWNTs or to selectively extract s-SWNTs from as-grown nanotubes are still required.

In recent years, several approaches to extract s-SWNTs from nanotube powders were explored using for instance chemical functionalization [9–11], DNA and polymers wrapping [12,13], and density gradient ultracentrifugation techniques [6]. The latter efficiently separates s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs, but traces of surfactant and density gradient materials limit the performances of the FET. Very recently, two groups have reported on the selective extraction of near-armchair s-SWNTs from nanotube powders using polyfluorene as extracting agent [14,15]. According to Nish *et al.* [14], the sample shows no detectable traces of m-SWNTs based only on optical spectroscopy. However, neither the electrical properties nor the fabrication of FET devices were addressed.

In this letter, we report on the electronic properties of FET consisting of *semiconducting-enriched single wall carbon nanotubes*, without detectable traces of *metallic nanotubes and impurities*, within our detection limits. This unprecedented achievement is made possible by ultracentrifugation ($250,000g$), sonication and filtration of solutions composed of SWNT powders with polyfluorene as extracting agent in toluene. Evidences are gathered by optical absorption, Raman and electrical measurements (see Fig. 1). We shall demonstrate that such s-SWNTs realize high-performances FET devices compare to networks/thin films of SWNTs and solution processable polymers/organic materials [1,6,16].

S-SWNTs solutions were prepared as follow. First, SWNTs powders (as-prepared HiPco, Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc.), PFO (Poly-9,9-di-n-octyl-fluorenyl-2,7-diyl, Sigma-Aldrich) and toluene were mixed in the following ratio SWNT (5 mg): PFO (5 mg): toluene (30 ml).
