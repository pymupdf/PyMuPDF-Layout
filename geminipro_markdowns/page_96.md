## EAGLE FORD

The Eagle Ford continues to have one of the highest internal rates of return of any of the US unconventional resource plays.

Because of its relatively low operating costs, the Eagle Ford remains profitable during current oil commodity pricing conditions. Sundance has quickly transformed the Eagle Ford position acquired in its merger with Texon Petroleum Ltd to its most valuable asset in its portfolio through development and growing its drilling inventory.
