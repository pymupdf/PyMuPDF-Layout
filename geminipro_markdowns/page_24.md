**Figure S1:** We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

**Figure S1 (summary):**
- **Panel A:** A plot showing four probability density curves for "Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed)". The curves, labeled 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0, are bell-shaped and shift to the right as the label value increases.
- **Panel B:** A scatter plot of "St. dev. dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed)" versus "Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed)". The points form a dense, roughly circular cloud, indicating no clear correlation between the mean and standard deviation.

**Figure S2:** Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is $r \approx 1$. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.

**Figure S2 (summary):**
- **Panel A:** A scatter plot of "Fisher Percentiles" versus "Pearson Percentiles". The data points form a nearly perfect straight line with a slope of 1, indicating an extremely high correlation (r=0.9999).
- **Panel B:** A scatter plot of "Mean dynamic FC" versus "Static FC". The data points show a strong positive linear correlation (r=0.97).
