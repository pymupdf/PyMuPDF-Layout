**Figure S1 (summary):**
*   **Panel A:** A probability density plot showing "Dynamic FC Magnitude (Fisher-transformed)" on the x-axis and "Prob. Density" on the y-axis. Four curves (blue, red, orange, purple) are positioned at different mean values roughly between -0.5 and 2.0. Despite different means, the curves have similar widths/variances.
*   **Panel B:** A scatter plot showing "St. dev. dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed)" on the y-axis versus "Mean dynamic FC (Fisher-transformed)" on the x-axis. The points form a dense cloud centered around a mean of 0.5 with no clear linear correlation.

**Figure S1:** We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

**Figure S2 (summary):**
*   **Panel A:** A scatter plot with axes "Fisher Percentiles" and "Pearson Percentiles" (both 0.0 to 1.0). The data points fall exactly on the diagonal line. An annotation reads "r=0.9999".
*   **Panel B:** A scatter plot with axes "Mean dynamic FC" and "Static FC" (values ranging roughly -2 to +2). The data points align closely to the diagonal red line. An annotation reads "r=0.97".

**Figure S2:** Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is $r \approx 1$. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
