## (57) ABSTRACT

There is provided a pattern forming method, including: (a) forming a film by using an electron beam-sensitive or extreme ultraviolet ray-sensitive resin composition containing a resin (A) having a repeating unit represented by Formula (1-0) and a repeating unit represented by Formula (1-2); (b) exposing the film by using an electron beam or extreme ultraviolet ray; and (c) developing the exposed film by using a developer containing an organic solvent to form a negative pattern, wherein a content of the repeating unit represented by Formula (1-0) is 45 mol % or more based on a whole repeating units in the resin (A).

![Formula (1-0)](formula-1-0.png)

**Formula (1-0) (summary):** A chemical structure representing a repeating polymer unit. It features a vinyl-type backbone with a substituent Ra. A side chain is attached via a linker L1 to an ester group, which is further connected to a substituted alkyl chain with groups R1, R2, R11, R12, and R13.

![Formula (1-2)](formula-1-2.png)

**Formula (1-2) (summary):** A chemical structure representing a second repeating polymer unit. It features a vinyl-type backbone with a substituent Rb. A side chain is attached via a linker L2 to a benzene ring. The benzene ring is substituted with `n1` hydroxyl groups `(OH)` and `n2` other substituent groups `(R3)`.
