## **Appendix B** 

Appendix B presents the procedure used to compute the sharp lower bound under MTR in Section 4 and Section 5. The following lemma is useful for reducing computational costs:

It is innocuous to assume that _{ak}[∞] k_ = _−∞_[satisfies] _[ a][k]_[+2] _[ −][a][k][ > δ]_[ for each integer] _[ k]_[.] 

**Proof.** I will show that for any sequence _{ak}[∞] k_ = _−∞[∈A][δ]_[ satisfying] _[ a][k]_[+2] _[ −][a][k][ ≤][δ]_[ for some integer] _[ k,]_[ one] can construct _{_ � _ak}[∞] k_ = _−∞[∈A][δ]_[ with][ �] _[a][k]_[+2] _[ −]_[�] _[a][k][ > δ]_[ for each integer] _[ k]_[ and]
