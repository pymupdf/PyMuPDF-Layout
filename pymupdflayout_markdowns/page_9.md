## IV. FITTING RESULTS 

## A. Model I 

At first, we divide the whole region of redshift into 4 bins (i.e., m = 3), the divided points and boundaries are (0, z 1 , z 2 , 1.8, ∞), where z 1 and z 2 are left as free parameters of the model, and 0 < z 1 < z 2 < 1.8. In the fourth bin we set w L = −1. It means that we divide the region with z ∈ (0, 1.8) into 3 bins and seek for two possible turning points of w de (z) in this region. The reconstructed w de of the best-fitted model is shown in Fig. 1,
