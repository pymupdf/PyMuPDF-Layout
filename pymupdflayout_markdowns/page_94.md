hile credit is used for electronic transactions in Western Europe and North America, the model is quite different in many “cash-based” economies around the world. And that’s where Euronet continues to look for new opportunities – particularly in the emerging markets of Central Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean.

**The Promise of Emerging Markets** _Expanding Poland’s Payment Infrastructure_ 

Although bank card use is just starting in these markets, the demand for non-cash payment is gaining momentum. The foundation for this marketplace is rapidly taking shape with greater technology support, well-designed infrastructure and rapidly growing networks, as well as a critical mass of users. So the shift to new electronic payment channels is on, and the number of electronic financial transactions has grown tremendously. 

_Although still underdeveloped compared to western economies, Poland is one of the most dynamic and promising markets in all of Europe._ 

Euronet Worldwide continuously monitors cash-based economies to identify their readiness to embrace electronic payment and transaction alternatives. With ATM, point-of-sale (POS), interactive voice response (IVR), Internet, mobile solutions and other innovative payment options, we can play a vital role in developing the electronic payments fabric of these countries. 

_Since entering Poland in 1995, Euronet Worldwide has become one of the largest transaction processing service providers in the country, establishing a network of over 600 ATMs and providing software to eight major banks. Our agreement for electronic airtime distribution with all three mobile phone operators in the country – ERA GSM, Plus GSM and IDEA Centertel – further confirms that Euronet is embedded in the financial payments fabric in Poland._ 

In Greece, we are delivering ATM outsourcing solutions for a number of multinational banks with Greek operations. For Credigen Bank in Hungary, we are helping to open up the consumer credit market to a new base of shoppers who can perform POS and ATM transactions over Euronet’s network. And in the Czech Republic we are providing outsourcing services for ABN AMRO’s Visa Charge Card Program. 

Looking ahead, we see great potential for extending Euronet’s brand into cash-based markets and for connecting a new world of users to dynamic transaction services.
