Contract conditions of December 2015 

Contract number: [ _complete_ ] 

E-mail is deemed to have been received by the receiving party on the day of dispatch of that e-mail, provided that it is sent to the e-mail address indicated in Article I.8. The sending party must be able to prove the date of dispatch. In the event that the sending party receives a non-delivery report, it must make every effort to ensure that the other party actually receives the communication by email or mail. In such a case, the sending party is not held in breach of its obligation to send such communication within a specified deadline. 

Mail sent to the contracting authority is deemed to have been received by the contracting authority on the date on which the department responsible referred to in Article I.8 registers it. 

_Formal notifications_ are considered to have been received by the receiving party on the date of receipt indicated in the proof received by the sending party that the message was delivered to the specified recipient. 

## **II.5.3. Submission of e-documents via e-PRIOR** 

If provided for in the special conditions, the exchange of electronic documents (edocuments) such as invoices between the parties is automated through the use of the _ePRIOR_ platform. This platform provides two possibilities for such exchanges: either through web services (machine-to-machine connection) or through a web application (the _supplier portal_ ). 

The contracting authority takes the necessary measures to implement and maintain electronic systems that enable the _supplier portal_ to be used effectively. 

In the case of machine-to-machine connection, a direct connection is established between the parties’ _back offices_ . In this case, the parties take the measures necessary on their side to implement and maintain electronic systems that enable the machine-to-machine connection to be used effectively. The electronic systems are specified in the _interface control document_ . The contractor (or leader in the case of a joint tender) must take the necessary technical measures to set up a machine-to-machine connection and at its own cost. 

If communication via the _supplier portal_ or via the web services (machine-to-machine connection) is hindered by factors beyond the control of one party, it must _notify_ the other immediately and the parties must take the necessary measures to restore this communication. 

If it is impossible to restore the communication within two working days, one party must _notify_ the other that alternative means of communication specified in Article II.5.1 will be used until the _supplier portal_ or the machine-to-machine connection is restored. 

When a change in the _interface control document_ requires adaptations, the contractor (or leader in the case of a joint tender) has up to six months from receipt of the _notification_ to implement this change. This period can be shortened by mutual agreement of the parties. This period does not apply to urgent measures required by the security policy of the contracting authority to ensure integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation of information and the availability of _e-PRIOR_ , which must be applied immediately.
