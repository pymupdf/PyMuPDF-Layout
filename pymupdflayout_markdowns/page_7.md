It is apparent form Eq. (A12) that the leading singularity originates from the first term, (A − 1)BC ≈ A − 1 ≈ −2d(y 1 − 0)(y 3 − y 2 ). Introducing new variables as in the Sec. III and integrating over x i s we obtain

Here again, the integrals are divergent on the upper limit. Similarly to the previous section we differentiate it once with respect to the variable α introduced in Eq. (14) in order to isolate the leading logarithmic singularity,

The remaining integrals are easily evaluated. The sub- sequent integration over α restores the singularity in the 

self energy correction,

where C is an integration constant. The singular part of Eq. (A15) is given by Eq. (24). 

## Appendix B: Leading singularities at the shadow mass shell, ω ∼ k y to the fourth order. 

In this appendix we evaluate the singular contributions to the Green function at the shadow mass shell, ω ∼ k y to fourth order in the coupling constant. We start with the expression (A1) introduced in App. A 1. In contrast to the discussion in App. A 1 we anticipate the singular- ity at ω = k y to come from the region y 2 ≫ x 2 , and introduce new variables accordingly, x 2 = ξy 2 , y 1 = ηy 2 . Performing integration over y 2 we obtain

We notice that the singularity at ω ∼ k y comes from the region of small ξ. Therefore we keep only the first term in the square brackets in Eq. (B1). After performing remaining integrations over ξ i s we obtain

We stress that contrary to the mass shell singularities discussed in App. A, where it was important to compute the self-energy, at the shadow mass shell it is enough to consider the Green function itself.
