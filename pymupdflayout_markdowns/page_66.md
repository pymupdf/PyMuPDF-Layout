## **Model AY11230** 

## **Model AY11234** 

## **SELECTING OBJECTIVE MAGNIFICATION** 

## **FOCUSING** 

- 1. Turn the focusing knob away or toward you until a clear image is viewed. 

- 1. There are two objectives. The lower 

- magnification objective has a greater depth of field and view. 

- 2. If the image is unclear, adjust the 

height of the elevator up or down, then turn the focusing knob again. 

- 2. In order to observe the specimen 

- easily use the lower magnification objective first. Then, by rotating the case, the magnification can be changed. 

## **ZOOM MAGNIFICATION** 

1. Turn the zoom magnification knob to the desired magnification and field of view. 

## **CHANGING THE INTERPUPILLARY DISTANCE** 

- 2. In most situations, it is recommended that you focus at the lowest magnification, then move to a higher magnification and re-focus as necessary. 

- 1. The distance between the observer's 

- pupils is the interpupillary distance. 

- 2. To adjust the interpupillary distance 

- rotate the prism caps until both eyes coincide with the image in the eyepiece. 

- 3. If the image is not clear to both eyes at the same time, the diopter ring may need adjustment. 

## **FOCUSING** 

## **DIOPTER RING ADJUSTMENT** 

- 1. Remove the lens protective cover. 2. Place the specimen on the working stage. 

- 1. To adjust the eyepiece for viewing with or without eyeglasses and for 

- differences in acuity between the right and left eyes, follow the following steps: 

- 3. Focus the specimen with the left eye 

- first while turning the focus knob until 

- the image appears clear and sharp. 

- a. Observe an image through the left eyepiece and bring a specific point into focus using the focus knob. b. By turning the diopter ring adjustment for the left eyepiece, bring the same point into sharp focus. 

- 4. Rotate the right eyepiece ring until the images in each eyepiece coincide and are sharp and clear. 

## **CHANGING THE BULB** 

- 1. Disconnect the power cord. 

- 2. When the bulb is cool, remove the 

- c.Then bring the same point into focus through the right eyepiece by turning the right diopter ring. d.With more than one viewer, each viewer should note their own diopter ring position for the left and right eyepieces, then before viewing set the diopter ring adjustments to that setting. 

- oblique illuminator cap and remove the halogen bulb with cap. 

- 3. Replace with a new halogen bulb. 

- 4. Open the window in the base plate and 

- replace the halogen lamp or fluorescent lamp of transmitted illuminator.

## **MODELS AY11230/11234** 

- 1. Disconnect the power cord from the 

## electrical outlet. 

- 1. The vertical tube can be used for 

- 2. When the bulb is cool, remove the oblique illuminator cap and remove the halogen bulb with cap. 

instructional viewing or to photograph the image with a digital camera or a micro TV unit 

2. Loosen the retention screw, then rotate the adjustment ring to change the length of the vertical tube. 

- 3. Replace with a new halogen bulb. 

- 4. Open the window in the base plate 

- and replace the halogen lamp or fluorescent lamp of transmitted

## **MICROSCOPE USAGE** 

BARSKA Model AY11236 is a powerful fixed power compound microscope designed for biological studies such as specimen examination. It can also be used for examining bacteria and for general clinical and medical studies and other scientific uses. 

## **CONSTRUCTION** 

BARSKA Model AY11236 is a fixed power compound microscope. It is constructed with two optical paths at the same angle. It is equipped with transmitted illumination. By using this instrument, the user can observe specimens at magnification from 40x to 1000x by selecting the desired objective lens. Coarse and fine focus adjustments provide accuracy and image detail. The rotating head allows the user to position the eyepieces for maximum viewing comfort and easy access to all adjustment knobs.
