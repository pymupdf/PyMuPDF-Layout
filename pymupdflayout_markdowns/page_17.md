**Example 3** _(Roy Model) In the Roy model, individuals self-select into treatment when their benefits from the treatment are greater than nonpecuniary costs for treatment participation. The extended Roy model assumes that the nonpecuniary cost is deterministic with the following selection equation:_

_where µ C_ ( _Z_ ) _represents nonpecuniary costs with a vector of observables Z. Then treated_ ( _D_ = 1) _and untreated people_ ( _D_ = 0) _are the observed groups satisfying support restrictions {Y_ 1 _− Y_ 0 _≥ µ C_ ( _Z_ ) _} and {Y_ 1 _− Y_ 0 _< µ C_ ( _Z_ ) _}, respectively._ 

**Example 4** _(DTE conditional on Potential Outcomes) The conditional DTE for the unobservable subgroup whose potential outcomes belong to a certain set C is written as_
