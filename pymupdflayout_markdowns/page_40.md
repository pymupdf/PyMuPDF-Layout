## **MISSED APPROACH INFORMATION** 

Missed approach information is shown in 3 locations on the chart: 

- The Middle Briefing Strip - The complete textual missed approach instructions are provided at the top of the ap- proach chart in the middle pilot briefing strip. 

- The Planview - The missed approach track is drawn using a thin, hash marked line with a directional arrow. If the missed approach fix is off the chart, the missed approach track shall extend to the chart border. 

- The Profile Box - Missed Approach Icons will be depicted in the upper left or upper right of the profile box. The Missed Approach Icons are intended to provide quick, at a glance intuitive guidance to the pilot, to supplement the textual missed approach instructions in the briefing strip. Space permitting, all textual missed approach in- structions will be graphically depicted in sequence. If space does not permit the depiction of all missed approach icons, only the first four icon boxes will be shown.
