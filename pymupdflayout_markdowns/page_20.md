Note that ǫ1,2,3 are all proportional to X which contains a double suppression factor. This feature was the main ingredient for the compatibility of the D-BESS model with the EW ¯ precision tests. In the five dimensional formulation of this model the ratio (g/g5)[2] originates from the presence of brane localized kinetic terms. 

The ǫ parameters can be tested against the experimental data. To do this, we need to express the model parameters in terms of the physical quantities. Proceeding again as in [60] we get the expressions the standard input parameters α, GF and mZ in terms of the model parameters. For convenience we rewrite the results:

In section VI, we will study the constraints on the model parameter space by EW precision parameter for two choices of the warp factor, b(y) ≡ 1 (flat extra dimension) and b(y) = e[−][2][ky] (a slice of AdS5). To this aim we need to invert (73), (74) and (75),

then, using definitions (65), obtain also ˜g and ˜g[′] .
