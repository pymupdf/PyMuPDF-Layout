## A. The Hamiltonian 

Let us consider the non-Hermitian FFA model defined by the following relations for the energy dispersion E(k) and spectral coupling v(k)

where κ 0 , κ a are two real-valued positive constants and 0 ≤ k ≤ π. The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming Im(E a ) = 0, is a special case of the FFA model previously investigated in Ref.[36], which is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of H spans the band (E 1 , E 2 ), with E 2 = −E 1 = 2κ 0 . The density of states for this model is given by

which shows van-Hove singularities at the band edges, whereas the positive spectral function V (E), defined by V (E) = ρ(E)|v(E)|[2] , reads

which is non-singular. Substitution of Eq.(49) into Eq.(11) yields the following expression for the self-energy Σ(z) [46]

and thus [see Eq.(12)]

The condition for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to possess a real-valued spectrum (i.e. to avoid complex-valued energies arising from bound states outside the continuum) is derived in Appendix B. Precisely, let ξ 1,2 be the two roots of the second-order algebraic equation

Then the Hamiltonian H has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if |ξ 1,2 | ≤ 1. Figure 2 shows the domain in the plane (Im(E a )/κ 0 , κ a /κ 0 ) where H has a purely continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values of the ratio |Re(E a )/κ 0 |. The domain lies in the sector

FIG. 2: Domains of non-existence of bound states for the Hamiltonian H in the (Im(E a )/κ 0 , κ a /κ 0 ) plane (shaded regions) for increasing values of the ratio |Re(E a )|/κ 0 . For a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im(E a ) ̸= 0, in the shaded regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of the shaded regions. 

κ a /κ 0 ≤ √2 and shrinks toward Im(E a )/κ 0 = κ a /κ 0 = 0 as |Re(E a )/κ 0 | → 2[−] . For |Re(E a )/κ 0 | ≤ 2, bound states do exist for any value of κ a /κ 0 and Im(E a )/κ 0 . The wider domain is attained for Re(E a ) = 0. In particular, for Re(E a ) = 0 and κ a /κ 0 = √2, from Eq.(52) it follows that H has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that

Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs.(19) and (20) and using Eqs.(49) and (51), a spectral singularity at energy E = E 0 , inside the interval (−2κ 0 , 2κ 0 ), is found provided that the following two equations are simultaneously satisfied

For arbitrarily given values of E a , κ a and κ 0 , the above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for E 0 in the range (−2κ 0 , 2κ 0 )], i.e. the non-Hermitian FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spectral singularities appear solely when a constraint among Re(E a )/κ 0 , Im(E a )/κ 0 and κ a /κ 0 is satisfied. Let us first assume κ a /κ 0 strictly smaller that √2. In this case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy E 0 =
