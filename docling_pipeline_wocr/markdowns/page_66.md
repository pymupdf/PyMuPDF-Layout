## OPERATION (cont.)

## Model AY11230

## SELECTING OBJECTIVE MAGNIFICATION

1. There are two objectives. The lower magnification objective has a greater depth of field and view.
2. In order to observe the specimen easily use the lower magnification objective first. Then, by rotating the case, the magnification can be changed.

## CHANGING THE INTERPUPILLARY DISTANCE

1. The distance between the observer's pupils is the interpupillary distance.
2. To adjust the interpupillary distance rotate the prism caps until both eyes coincide with the image in the eyepiece.

## FOCUSING

1. Remove the lens protective cover.
2. Place the specimen on the working stage.
3. Focus the specimen with the left eye first while turning the focus knob until the image appears clear and sharp.
4. Rotate the right eyepiece ring until the images in each eyepiece coincide and are sharp and clear.

## CHANGING THE BULB

1. Disconnect the power cord.
2. When the bulb is cool, remove the oblique illuminator cap and remove the halogen bulb with cap.
3. Replace with a new halogen bulb.
4. Open the window in the base plate and replace the halogen lamp or fluorescent lamp of transmitted illuminator.

## USING THE VERTICAL TUBE MODELS AY11230/11234

1. The vertical tube can be used for instructional viewing or to photograph the image with a digital camera or a micro TV unit
2. Loosen the retention screw, then rotate the adjustment ring to change the length of the vertical tube.
3. Make sure that both the images in

## FOCUSING Model AY11234

1. Turn the focusing knob away or toward you until a clear image is viewed.
2. If the image is unclear, adjust the height of the elevator up or down, then turn the focusing knob again.

## ZOOM MAGNIFICATION

1. Turn the zoom magnification knob to the desired magnification and field of view.
2. In most situations, it is recommended that you focus at the lowest magnification, then move to a higher magnification and re-focus as necessary.
3. If the image is not clear to both eyes at the same time, the diopter ring may need adjustment.

## DIOPTER RING ADJUSTMENT

1. To adjust the eyepiece for viewing with or without eyeglasses and for differences in acuity between the right and left eyes, follow the following steps:
- a. Observe an image through the left eyepiece and bring a specific point into focus using the focus knob.
- b. By turning the diopter ring adjustment for the left eyepiece, bring the same point into sharp focus.
4. c.Then bring the same point into focus through the right eyepiece by turning the right diopter ring.
5. d.With more than one viewer, each viewer should note their own diopter ring position for the left and right eyepieces, then before viewing set the diopter ring adjustments to that setting.

## CHANGING THE BULB

1. Disconnect the power cord from the electrical outlet.
2. When the bulb is cool, remove the oblique illuminator cap and remove the halogen bulb with cap.
