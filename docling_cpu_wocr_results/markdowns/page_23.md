Let us consider the non-Hermitian FFA model defined by the following relations for the energy dispersion E ( k ) and spectral coupling v ( k ) 1 2

where κ 0 , κ a are two real-valued positive constants and 0 ≤ k ≤ π . The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming Im( E a ) = 0, is a special case of the FFA model previously investigated in Ref.[36], which is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of H spans the band ( E 1 , E 2 ), with E 2 = -E 1 = 2 κ 0 . The density of states for this model is given by

which shows van-Hove singularities at the band edges, whereas the positive spectral function V ( E ), defined by V ( E ) = ρ ( E ) | v ( E ) | 2 , reads

which is non-singular. Substitution of Eq.(49) into Eq.(11) yields the following expression for the self-energy Σ( z ) [46]

and thus [see Eq.(12)]

The condition for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to possess a real-valued spectrum (i.e. to avoid complex-valued energies arising from bound states outside the continuum) is derived in Appendix B. Precisely, let ξ 1 , 2 be the two roots of the second-order algebraic equation

Then the Hamiltonian H has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if | ξ 1 , 2 | ≤ 1. Figure 2 shows the domain in the plane (Im( E a ) /κ 0 , κ a /κ 0 ) where H has a purely continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values of the ratio | Re( E a ) /κ 0 | . The domain lies in the sector

FIG. 2: Domains of non-existence of bound states for the Hamiltonian H in the (Im( E a ) /κ 0 , κ a /κ 0 ) plane (shaded regions) for increasing values of the ratio | Re( E a ) | /κ 0 . For a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im( E a ) = 0, in the shaded regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of the shaded regions.

κ a /κ 0 ≤ √ 2 and shrinks toward Im( E a ) /κ 0 = κ a /κ 0 = 0 as | Re( E a ) /κ 0 |→ 2 -. For | Re( E a ) /κ 0 | ≤ 2, bound states do exist for any value of κ a /κ 0 and Im( E a ) /κ 0 . The wider domain is attained for Re( E a ) = 0. In particular, for Re( E a ) = 0 and κ a /κ 0 = √ 2, from Eq.(52) it follows that H has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that

Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs.(19) and (20) and using Eqs.(49) and (51), a spectral singularity at energy E = E 0 , inside the interval ( -2 κ 0 , 2 κ 0 ), is found provided that the following two equations are simultaneously satisfied

For arbitrarily given values of E a , κ a and κ 0 , the above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for E 0 in the range ( -2 κ 0 , 2 κ 0 )], i.e. the non-Hermitian FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spectral singularities appear solely when a constraint among Re( E a ) /κ 0 , Im( E a ) /κ 0 and κ a /κ 0 is satisfied. Let us first assume κ a /κ 0 strictly smaller that √ 2. In this case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy E 0 =
