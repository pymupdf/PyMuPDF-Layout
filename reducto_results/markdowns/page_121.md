The image contains chemical structures including polymers and organic molecules. Some notable groups include sulfonates, fluorinated sulfonyl compounds, biaryl groups, and triphenylsulfonium ions.

P-54

Two chemical structures are shown. The structure on the left has a repeating unit of -CH2-CH- with a naphthalene ring and an OH group attached to the CH. The structure on the right has a repeating unit of -CH2-C(CH3)- with a carbonyl group attached. An ester is formed by connecting the carbonyl to a 6-membered ring containing a methoxy group (OMe).

Left repeat unit
- Backbone: —(CH2–C–)—
- Substituents on the tertiary carbon: CH3 and a carbonyl ester: C(=O)–O–Ar
- Pendant group: an ester-linked biphenyl (O–phenyl–phenyl). Concise formula: —[CH2–C(CH3)(COO–biphenyl)]—

Right repeat unit
- Backbone: —(CH2–CH–)—
- Pendant group: a para-phenyl substituent bearing an alkoxy-sulfonyl–perfluoroalkyl–sulfonate: Ar–O–SO2–(CF2)4–SO3
- Concise formula: —[CH2–CH(Ph–O–SO2–(CF2)4–SO3)]— (Ph = phenyl, CF2 chain shown as four CF2 units in the drawing)

## <Other Components>

[0317] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are described below.

## (Photo-Acid Generator)

[0318] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae (ZI), (ZII) and(ZIII):
