The polar group which may be possessed by the repeating unit having a polar group may be a carbonate group such as a cyclic carbonate ester structure, and the resin (A) prefer- ably contain a repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure.

The repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester struc- 20

ture is preferably the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1).

Formula: (A-1)

Key structural features
- Polymer repeating unit: backbone fragment is a substituted vinyl/methacrylate-type unit: –[CH(R1)–C(=O)–O–A–(cyclic carbonate)]–
- Pendant group: five‑membered cyclic carbonate (1,3‑dioxolan‑2‑one) attached via an oxygen to linker A.
- Ring substituent: the ring carbon between the two oxygens bears Z–(R2)n (dashed bond in figure indicates substitution at that carbon).
- Variable groups: R1 (on backbone carbon), A (linker between ester oxygen and cyclic carbonate), Z and (R2)n (substituents on the cyclic carbonate ring).

ASCII connectivity (approximate)
-[-CH(R1)-C(=O)-O-A-O-CR-(O)-C(=O)-]- with Z-(R2)n on the CR in the cyclic carbonate ring.

The alkyl group represented by R may have a substitu- ent such as a fluorine atom. R represents preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluormethyl group, hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluormethyl group, and more preferably a methyl group.

The substituent represented by R ² is, for example, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxycarbonylamino group. The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, a straight alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group and a butyl group; and a branched alkyl group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. An alkyl group group, an isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. An alkyl group may have a substituent such as a hydroxyl group.

In one aspect of the present invention, A is preferably a single bond, or an alkylene group.

The moncyclic group containing OC(=O) 0, represented by Z is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which nд-2 to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a), and preferably a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring (n=2 or 3), and more preferably a 5-membered ring (n-2).

The polycyclic group containing O C(=O)O represented by Z may, for example, be a structure in which a cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following For- mula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclid hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydro- carbon group or a heterocyclic ring.

In addition, R in the following specific examples has the same meaning as R in Formula (A-1).

- Context: Examples of a divalent linking group "A" (attached to a polymer repeat unit). Each structure shows a polymer backbone (left squiggle) with a pendant methacrylate-type unit bearing R_A^1 on the tertiary carbon and an ester linkage C(=O)–O to the spacer.

- Structure 1 (left):
  - Pendant: –C(R_A^1)(–)–C(=O)–O–CH2–CH2–O–(five‑membered cyclic anhydride)
  - Terminal ring: five-membered cyclic anhydride (succinic anhydride-like)

- Structure 2 (right):
  - Pendant: –C(R_A^1)(–)–C(=O)–O–CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–O–(five‑membered cyclic anhydride)
  - Terminal ring: same five‑membered cyclic anhydride

- Key entities: polymer repeat unit, R_A^1 substituent, ester linkage (C=O–O), ether-containing spacer variants (linear ethylene glycol‑type vs. branched isopropylidene spacer), terminal cyclic anhydride.
