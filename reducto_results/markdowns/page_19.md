The image shows a 2D plot with axes labeled as Y₀ and Y₁. There are two lines plotted on the graph: one represents Y₁ = Y₀, and the other represents Y₁ = (t₁ - t𝓌)/(t₀ - t𝓌) Y₀ - (t₁ - t₀)/(t₀ - t𝓌)w. The area above the second line is shaded in yellow.

The function ϕ can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum Bk = (−∞, bk ) with bk+1 ≤ bk and bk ∈ [−∞, ∞] for every integer k. By Theorem 1, for δ > 0, B D k is written as

{y1 € R|³yo < bk s.t. 0 ≤ yı – Yo < and (to - tw) y1 - (t1 - tw) yo ≤ - (t₁ - to) w} BR = U{y1 € R|³yo < bk+1 S.t. Y1 - Yo≥ 8 and (to - tw) y1 - (t₁ - tw) yo ≤ - (t₁ - to) w} .

bk+1 ≤ bk.

The image shows three plots, (a), (b), and (c), illustrating  BDk for Bk = (-∞, bk) and Bk+1 = (-∞, bk+1). The plots show the relationship between Y₀ and Y₁. Each plot includes the line Y₁ = Y₀+δ and lines intersect at bk and bk+1. Each plot also shows a vertical rectangle which is colored in either purple or green.

Case a) bk+1 < bk ≤ to-tw & + w t1-to

If bk+1 bk to-tw8+w, as illustrated in Figure A.5(a), for any yo <bk+1 ≤ to-tw 8+w, there exists t1-to
