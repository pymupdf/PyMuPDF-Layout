## RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is

avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be indicated only once within the identification box. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only

| Callout / Legend item | Text or example shown in image |
|---|---|
| FSS Radio Frequencies | 122.1R (left), 123.6 (right) |
| VORTAC (name) | PONTIAC (blue) |
| ASOS/AWOS | circled "A" symbol near right frequency |
| Identifier | small letters shown inside identification box (labelled "Identifier") |
| Morse Code | Morse pattern shown inside identification box (labelled "Morse Code") |
| NDB Frequency | 379° (star marker next to it) |
| Frequency | (arrow labelled "Frequency" pointing to numeric entries such as 122.1R / 123.6) |
| Channel | (callout "Channel" pointing to channel field in ID box) |
| Operational note | "FSS oper 0600-2200" and "Rancho Murieta FSS other times." |
| Crosshatch | "Crosshatch indicates Shutdown status" |
| Operates less | "Operates less continuous or on-request" |

those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio aids.

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

| Item | Value / Description |
|---|---|
| Chart type | VOR compass rose / NAVAID depiction |
| NAVAID type (top of box) | VOR |
| Name | SALEM |
| Frequency (MHz) | 114.3 |
| Identifier | SVM |
| Collocation symbol | Small open circle shown (indicates NAVAID located on airport) |
| NAVAID box detail | Type on top line; identifier and frequency shown; short dashed lines shown to right of identifier |
| Radial shown | A radial drawn from the VOR toward roughly 030° (approximate bearing) |
| Compass rose ticks/labels | Full 360° rose with ticks (minor ticks ~5°) and major labels at 30° increments (labels displayed as 0, 3, 6, 9, ... corresponding to 360°, 030°, 060°, 090°, ...) |
| Caption/note (on figure) | "Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport. Type of NAVAID shown in top of box." |

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or “DME” (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

## AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section). Public use airports:



Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069’ or some multiple runways less than 8069’



Hard-surfaced runways 1500’ to 8069’

[ ]

Other than hard-surfaced runways



Seaplane bases

Military airports:
[x]
O
Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation DND (Department of National Defense).

Fuel Available:



Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.

Other airports with or without fuel:
