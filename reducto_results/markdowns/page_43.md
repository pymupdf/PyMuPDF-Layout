## RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is

avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be indicated only once within the identification box. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only

Key details from the image:

*   **NAVAID:** VORTAC
*   **Name:** PONTIAC
*   **Identifier:** PTK
*   **Frequencies:** 122.1R, 123.6
*   **NDB Frequency:** 379 (with star symbol, indicating on request)
*   **TACAN Channel:** 47
*   **Operational Note:** FSS operates 0600-2200, Rancho Murleta FSS other times.
*   **Shutdown Status:** Crosshatch indicates shutdown
*   **Radio Frequencies:** FSS radio frequencies displayed.
*   **ASOS/AWOS**: There is ASOS/AWOS system in place.

those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio aids.

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

- NAVAID type (top of box): VOR
- Name: SALEM
- Frequency: 114.3 MHz
- Identifier: SVM (shown in the box; dashed lines likely representing Morse ID)
- Symbol: Open circle around airport icon = NAVAID is collocated with an airport
- Diagram elements: compass rose with radial to the VOR; label caption: "Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport. Type of NAVAID shown in top of box."

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or “DME” (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

## AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section). Public use airports:



Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069’ or some multiple runways less than 8069’



Hard-surfaced runways 1500’ to 8069’

[ ]

Other than hard-surfaced runways



Seaplane bases

Military airports:
[x]
O
Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation DND (Department of National Defense).

Fuel Available:



Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.
