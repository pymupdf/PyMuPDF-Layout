Panel A — Density curves (legend colors: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0)
| Static FC (legend) | Color | Approx peak (Fisher-transformed) | Approx SD | Approx central range (±2 SD) |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.5 | blue | 0.2 | 0.25 | -0.3 to 0.7 |
| 1.0 | red | 0.8 | 0.25 | 0.3 to 1.3 |
| 1.5 | orange/yellow | 1.4 | 0.25 | 0.9 to 1.9 |
| 2.0 | purple | 2.0 | 0.25 | 1.5 to 2.5 |

Panel B — Scatter of temporal mean vs standard deviation (Fisher-transformed)
| Metric | Approx observed range | Typical/cluster |
|---|---:|---|
| Mean dynamic FC (x‑axis) | -1 to 3 | most points ≈ -0.5 to 1.0 |
| Std. dev. dynamic FC (y‑axis) | 0.1 to 0.7 | most points ≈ 0.2 to 0.45 |
| Relationship | no systematic relationship | dense cloud at mean ≈ 0 to 0.5, std ≈ 0.25–0.4 |

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

| Plot | X-axis          | Y-axis                 | Correlation (r) |
|------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| A    | Pearson Percentiles | Fisher Percentiles     | 0.9999          |
| B    | Static FC       | Mean Dynamic FC        | 0.97            |

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is r ≈ 1. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
