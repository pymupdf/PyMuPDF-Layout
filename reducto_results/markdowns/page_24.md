Panel A

| Static FC (legend) | Curve color | Approx. peak (Fisher-transformed dynamic FC) | Approx. spread (SD) | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---|
| 0.5 | blue | 0.2 | ~0.25 | Narrow, leftmost |
| 1.0 | red | 0.9 | ~0.25 | Similar variance to others |
| 1.5 | orange/gold | 1.5 | ~0.25 | Similar variance to others |
| 2.0 | purple | 2.1 | ~0.25 | Rightmost |

Panel B

| Metric | Value / observation |
|---|---|
| X-axis (Mean dynamic FC, Fisher-transformed) range | ≈ -1 to 3 |
| Y-axis (Std. dev. dynamic FC, Fisher-transformed) range | ≈ 0.1 to 0.7 |
| Central cluster (most points) | Mean ≈ -0.5 to 1.0; Std ≈ 0.2 to 0.45 |
| Relationship between mean and std | No systematic relationship / no clear correlation

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

| Plot | X-axis               | Y-axis                | Correlation (r) |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| A    | Pearson Percentiles  | Fisher Percentiles    | 0.9999            |
| B    | Static FC            | Mean dynamic FC       | 0.97              |

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is r ≈ 1. (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
