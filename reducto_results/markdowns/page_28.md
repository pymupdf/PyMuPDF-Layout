AIRPLANE PERFORMANCE

due to thc~low combustion pressure and values of c, from 2.0 to 4.0 are typical with aftetburner operation.

The turbojet engine usually has a strong

preference fot high RPM to produce low specific fuel consumption. Since the normal rated

thrust condition is a particular design point
for the engine, the minimum value of c, will
occur at or near this range of RPM. The

illustration of figure 2.10  shows a typical vatiation of c, with percent maximum RPM where

values of RPM less than 80 to 85 percent produce a specific fuel consumption much greater

than the minimum obtainable. This preference for high.RPM to obtain low values of

C, is very pronounced in the fixed geometry
engine. Turbojet engines with multispool [ ]
compressors tend to be less sensitive in this
respect and are more flexible in their operating
characteristics. Whenever low values of cI ate
necessary to obtain range or endurance, the
preference of the turboiet engine for the design
operating RPM can be a factor of great
influence.

Altitude is one factor which strongly affects
the performance of the turbojet engine. An [ ]
increase in altitude produces a decrease in

density and pressure and, if below the tropopause, a decrease in temperature. If a typical

nonaftcrbutning turbojet engine is operated at

a constant RPM and true airspeed, the vatiation of thtust and specific fuel consumption

with altitude can be approximated from figure
221. The variation of density in the standard [ ]
atmosphere is shown by the values of density
ratio at vatious altitudes. Typical values of
the density ratio at specific altitudes are as
follows:

| Altitude, ft.:   | Density ratio   |
|-|-|
| Sea level.       | 1.000           |
| 5,000...         | .8617           |
| 10,000..         | .7385           |
| 22,000..         | .4976           |
| 35,000..         | .3099           |
| 40,000.          | .2462           |
| 50,000.          | .1532           |

If the fixed geometry engine is operated at a

constant V (TAS) in subsonic flight and con-
 stant N (RPM) the inlet velocity, inlet ram,

and compressor pressure ratio are essentially

constant with altitude. An increase in altitude then causes the engine air mass flow to

decrease in a manner very nearly identical to

the altitude density ratio. Of coutsc, this decrease in mass flow will produce a significant

e&ct on the output thrust of the engine.
Actually, the variation of thrust with altitude
is not quite as severe as the density variation
because favorable decreases in temperature
occut. The decrease in inlet air temperature [ ]
will provide a relatively greater combustion
gas &ergy and allow a greater jet velocity.
The increase in jet velocity somewhat offsets

the decrease in mass flow. Of course, an increase in altitude provides lower temperatures

below the tropopause. Above the tropopause,
no further favorable decrease in temperature
takes place so a more rapid variation of thrust
will take place. The approximate variation
of thrust with altitude is represented by figure

2.11 and some typical values at specific altitudes ate as follows :

| Altitude, ft.:   | Thrust at altitude<br />Ratio of Thrust at sea level)   |
|-|-|
| Sea level.       | 1.000                                                   |
| 5,000...         | .888                                                    |
| 10,000           | .785                                                    |
| 20,000.          | .604                                                    |
| 35,000.          | .392                                                    |
| 40,000.          | .315                                                    |
| 50,000.          | .180                                                    |

Since the change in density with altitude is quite rapid at low altitude turbojet takeoff petformance wil1 Abe greatly affected at high altitude. Also note that the thrust at 35,000 ft. is approximately 39 percent of the sea level value.

The thrust added by the afterburner of a turbojet engine is not affected so greatly by altitude as the basic engine thrust. The use of afterburner may provide a thrust increase of 50 percent at low altitude or as much as 100 percent at high altitude.
