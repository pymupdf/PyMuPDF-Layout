The image shows several chemical structures of polymers. The structures vary by the substituent on the aromatic ring, including alcohol and ether groups with different alkyl or cyclic groups.


- General motif: polymer backbone (chain continued) → para‑substituted phenyl ring → cyclohexyl substituent bearing alcohol functionality.

- Left structure:
  - Repeating unit (chain continued) — para‑phenyl — cyclohexane ring.
  - Cyclohexane substituents: one OH (secondary alcohol) and one OMe (MeO) group.

- Right structure:
  - Same backbone → para‑phenyl → cyclohexane ring.
  - Cyclohexane substituents: two OH groups (i.e., dihydroxy cyclohexyl substituent).

- Key entities: polymer backbone, para‑phenyl spacer, cyclohexyl alcohol moiety (mono‑methoxy/mono‑hydroxy variant on left; di‑hydroxy variant on right).

[0144] As the amount of the repeating unit BN2, the lower limit is preferably 5 mo! %, more preferably 10 mo! % based on the whole repeating units constituting the component (B). The upper limit is preferably 70 mo! %, more preferably 60 mo!%.

[0145] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) preferably contains the repeating unit BN2, additionally at least one kind of a repeating unit selected from the repeating units B3 to B5 in addition to the repeating unit Bl in view of coexisting high etching durability and resolution. In this case, these repeating units are contained in an amount of 60 mo! % or more, more preferably 70 mo! % or more, and still more preferably 80 mo! % or more in the whole repeating units. This securely gives properties demanded for the inventive negative resist composition.

[0146] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) may contain a lactone structure, a (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group such as a hydroxy group other than the phenolic hydroxy group, and other repeating units in order to fine-tune the properties of a resist film. Illustrative examples of the (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group include the units shown by the following general formulae (bl) to (b3). These units can be used supplementary as a unit to control the unit to give adhesiveness to a substrate and the solubility without showing acidity.

The image shows a chemical formula, labeled (b1). The molecule includes repeating units with carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms forming ester and lactone groups, along with a cyclic structure labeled G1 and a substituent R4.

The image depicts a chemical structure, labeled (b2). It includes functional groups with variables like "R4" and "G2".
