- General: polymer repeat unit (methacrylate backbone shown) with varied ester side-chains.

- Series A — ester → (CH2)2 spacer → para-phenyl → benzylic secondary alcohol (H shown). R at benzylic C varies:
  - R = methyl
  - R = ethyl
  - R = n‑propyl
  - R = isopropyl
  - R = n‑butyl

- Series B — para‑tert‑butylphenyl methacrylates with an ether/alkoxy substituent at the ring:
  - O–bicyclic norbornyl/borneyl-type group
  - O–isopropyl
  - O–cyclohexyl
  - O–ethyl

- Notable features: polymer backbone indicated; benzylic stereocenter shown (H) in the alcohol-containing monomers; variation focuses on alkyl/alkoxy identity on the phenyl-bearing side chain.

- Figure: two repeating units (polymer chain continued).
- Left unit: vinyl-type backbone → para‑phenyl ring → cyclohexane bearing a benzylic OH and a methoxy substituent (MeO) on the cyclohexane.
- Right unit: same backbone → para‑phenyl → cyclohexane bearing a benzylic OH and an additional hydroxyl on the cyclohexane (diol motif).
- Caption note: “-continued” indicates polymer chain continuation.
- Context from text: BN2 repeating unit content — lower limit preferably 5 mol% (more preferably 10 mol%); upper limit preferably 70 mol% (more preferably 60 mol%).

[0144] As the amount of the repeating unit BN2, the lower limit is preferably 5 mo! %, more preferably 10 mo! % based on the whole repeating units constituting the component (B). The upper limit is preferably 70 mo! %, more preferably 60 mo!%.

[0145] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) preferably contains the repeating unit BN2, additionally at least one kind of a repeating unit selected from the repeating units B3 to B5 in addition to the repeating unit Bl in view of coexisting high etching durability and resolution. In this case, these repeating units are contained in an amount of 60 mo! % or more, more preferably 70 mo! % or more, and still more preferably 80 mo! % or more in the whole repeating units. This securely gives properties demanded for the inventive negative resist composition.

[0146] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) may contain a lactone structure, a (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group such as a hydroxy group other than the phenolic hydroxy group, and other repeating units in order to fine-tune the properties of a resist film. Illustrative examples of the (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group include the units shown by the following general formulae (bl) to (b3). These units can be used supplementary as a unit to control the unit to give adhesiveness to a substrate and the solubility without showing acidity.

The image shows chemical structure (b1) containing a lactone structure and (meth)acrylate ester unit.

The image shows a chemical structure labeled "(b2)". The structure includes repeating units and groups labeled as R^4 and G^2. There is also an adamantane-like cage with an OH group.
