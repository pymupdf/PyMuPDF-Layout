Note that ǫ 1 ,2 ,3 are all proportional to X which contains a double suppression factor. This feature was the main ingredient for the compatibility of the D-BESS model with the EW precision tests. In the five dimensional formulation of this model the ratio (g/g ¯ 5) 2 originates from the presence of brane localized kinetic terms.

The ǫ parameters can be tested against the experimental data. To do this, we need to express the model parameters in terms of the physical quantities. Proceeding again as in [60] we get the expressions the standard input parameters α, GF and mZ in terms of the model parameters. For convenience we rewrite the results:

In section VI, we will study the constraints on the model parameter space by EW precision parameter for two choices of the warp factor, b(y ) ≡ 1 (flat extra dimension) and b (y) = e−2ky (a slice of AdS5). To this aim we need to invert (73), (74) and (75),

then, using definitions (65), obtain also ğ and ğ'.
