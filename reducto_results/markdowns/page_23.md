## A. The Hamiltonian

Let us consider the non-Hermitian FFA model defined by the following relations for the energy dispersion E(k) and spectral coupling v(k)

E(k) = -2кo cosk, v(k) == V П -Ka sin k (47)

where κ0, κa are two real-valued positive constants and 0 ≤ k ≤ π. The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming Im(Ea ) = 0, is a special case of the FFA model previously investigated in Ref.[36], which is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of H spans the band (E1 , E2 ), with E 2 = −E1 = 2κ0. The density of states for this model is given by

p(E) ( )-{ ДЕ 4K²-E2 -2кo < E < 2KO
Әк 0 |E| > 2KO
(48)

which shows van-Hove singularities at the band edges, whereas the positive spectral function V(E), defined by V(E) = p(E)|v(E)|2, reads

V(E) = { πKO 2ко E −2ko < E < 2KO (49)
0 |E| > 2KO

which is non-singular. Substitution of Eq.(49) into Eq.(11) yields the following expression for the self-energy Σ( z) [46]

Σ (=) = −1 (√4K² - 2² + iz) 2K (50)

and thus [see Eq.(12)]

A(E) = Re (Σ(z = ±10+)) (51)

The condition for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to possess a real-valued spectrum (i.e. to avoid complex-valued energies arising from bound states outside the continuum) is derived in Appendix B. Precisely, let ξ1,2 be the two roots of the second-order algebraic equation

Then the Hamiltonian H has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if |ξ1,2| ≤ 1. Figure 2 shows the domain in the plane (Im(E a )/κ0, κa/κ0) where H has a purely continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values of the ratio |Re(Ea )/κ0|. The domain lies in the sector

The image shows domains of non-existence of bound states for the Hamiltonian H in the (Im(Ea)/κ0, κa/κ0) plane for increasing values of the ratio |Re(Ea)/κ0|.

FIG. 2: Domains of non-existence of bound states for the Hamiltonian H in the (Im(Ea )/κ0 , κa /κ0 ) plane (shaded regions) for increasing values of the ratio |Re(Ea)|/κ0 . For a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im(Ea ) 6= 0, in the shaded regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of the shaded regions.

Ka/Ko√√2 and shrinks toward Im(Ea)/K0 = Ka/K0 = 0 as |Re(Eɑ)/Ko| →2¯. For |Re(Ea)/K0| ≤ 2, bound states do exist for any value of Ka/Ko and Im(Ea)/Ko. The wider domain is attained for Re(Ea) = 0. In particular, for Re(Ea) = 0 and Ka/Ko √2, from Eq. (52) it follows = that H has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that

- 2кo < Im(Ea) < 2ko. (53)

Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs.(19) and (20) and using Eqs.(49) and (51), a spectral singularity at energy E = E0 , inside the interval (−2κ0, 2κ0), is found provided that the following two equations are simultaneously satisfied

Επ 2
Im(Ea) = 1 (54)

Re(Ea) = (1-1) Eo. (55)

For arbitrarily given values of Ea, ka and кo, the above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for Eo in the range (-2KO, 2KO)], i.e. the non-Hermitian FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spec- tral singularities appear solely when a constraint among Re(Ea) Ko, Im(Ea)/Ko and Ka/Ko is satisfied. Let us first assume Ka/Ko strictly smaller that √2. In this case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy Ɛo
