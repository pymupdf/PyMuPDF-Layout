The fourth set of observational data is 12 Hubble evolution data from [21] and [22], its χ 2 H is defined as

12 12 [H(z) Hob(i)]²
X² = Σ (25)
i=1 σ
Note that redshifts of these data fall in the region z = (0, 1.75).

## IV. FITTING RESULTS

## A. Model I

At first, we divide the whole region of redshift into 4 bins (i.e., m = 3), the divided points and boundaries are (0, z1, z2, 1.8, ∞), where z1 and z2 are left as free parameters of the model, and 0 < z 1 < z 2 < 1.8. In the fourth bin we set wL = −1. It means that we divide the region with z ∈ (0, 1.8) into 3 bins and seek for two possible turning points of wde(z) in this region. The reconstructed wde of the best-fitted model is shown in Fig. 1,
