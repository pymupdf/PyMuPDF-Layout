In formula (F2), Rx represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As preferred substituents that the alkyl group represented by Rx may have, a hydroxyl group and a halogen atom are exemplified.

Fa represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched alkylene group, and preferably a single bond.

Fb represents a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon
group.

Fc represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched 20

alkylene group, and preferably a single bond or a methylene group.

F₁ represents a group represented by formula (F1).

P1 represents from 1 to 3.

As the cyclic hydrocarbon group represented by Fb, a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, or a norbomyl group is preferred.

The specific examples of the repeating units having the structure represented by formula (Fl) are shown below.

| Example (position) | Backbone repeating fragment | Linkage to norbornyl unit | Pendant group (attached to norbornyl) |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Top-left | —( )— (simple alkyl backbone, no carbonyl shown) | Direct C–C alkyl linkage (pendant norbornyl directly on main chain) | norbornyl–CH2–C(CF3)2–OH (gem‑bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol) |
| Top-right | —(CH2–C(CH3)–)… (methacrylate-type backbone unit) | Ester: …–C(=O)–O–norbornyl (methacrylic ester linkage) | norbornyl–CH2–C(CF3)2–OH (gem‑bis(trifluoromethyl)carbinol) |

Key entities: bicyclic alicyclic (norbornyl) hydrocarbon pendant, geminal bis(trifluoromethyl) carbinol unit [(CF3)2C–OH], and either direct alkyl or ester (methacrylate/acrylate) linkages to the polymer backbone.

The alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin in the invention can contain various kinds of repeating structural units, besides the above repeating structural units, for the purpose of the adjustments of dry etching resistance, aptitude for standard developing solutions, adhesion to a substrate, for standard developing solutions, adhesion to a substrate, resist profile, and further, general requisite performances of resists, e.g., resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity.

As these repeating structural units, the repeating structural units corresponding to the monomers shown below can be exemplified, but the invention is not restricted thereto.

	(3) Alkali developability,

	(4) Decrease of layer thickness (hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, selection of an alkali-soluble group),

(6) Dry etching resistance.

The examples of such monomers include compounds hav- ing one addition polymerizable unsaturated bond selected from acrylic esters, methacrylic esters, acrylamides, meth- acryl-amides, allyl compounds, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned compounds, addition polymerizable unsaturated compounds copolymerizable with the monomers corresponding to the above various repeating structural units may be used for copolymerization.

In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin, the molar ratio of the content of each repeating struc- tural unit is arbitrarily set to adjust dry etching resistance, aptitude for standard developing solutions of a resist, adhe- sion to a substrate, and resist profile, in addition, general requisite performances of a resist, e.g., resolution, heat resis- tance and sensitivity.
