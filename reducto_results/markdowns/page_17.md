Figure 2: Concave treatment response and convex treatment response

Concavity and convexity of the treatment response function imply Pr (Yo-W > \₁=Y, Y₁ ≥ Y ≥ W) = 1 to-tw and Pr (Yo-WY-Yo, Y₁ ≥ Yo≥ W) = 1, respectively, where ta is a level of input for each treatment to-tw status d = {0,1} while tw is a level of input without the treatment and tw < to < t₁. Given W = w, concavity and convexity of the treatment response function restrict the support of (Yo, Y₁) to the region below the straight line Y₁ t₁-tw Yo₁-tow and above the straight line Y₁ = Yo, and to the region above two = to-tw to-tw straight lines Y₁ t₁-tw Yot-tow and Y₁ = Yo, respectively, as shown in Figures 1(b) and (c). to-tw to-tw

Example 3 (Roy Model) In the Roy model, individuals self-select into treatment when their benefits from the treatment are greater than nonpecuniary costs for treatment participation. The extended Roy model assumes that the nonpecuniary cost is deterministic with the following selection equation:

D=1{Y₁- Yo≥ μc (Z)},

where μc (Z) represents nonpecuniary costs with a vector of observables Z. Then treated (D = 1) and untreated people (D = 0) are the observed groups satisfying support restrictions {Y₁ = Y ≥ µc (Z)} and {Y₁ Yoμc (Z)}, respectively.

Example 4 (DTE conditional on Potential Outcomes) The conditional DTE for the unobservable subgroup whose potential outcomes belong to a certain set C is written as

Pr {Y₁ - Yo≤8 (Yo, Y₁) € C}.
