lb instead of 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane of Chemical Formula la, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7 (yield: 55%).

Polyacrolein thus obtained (20 g), ethane-1,2-diol (150 g), toluene-p-sulfonic acid (1 g) and benzene (200 g) were placed in a 1000-ml round-bottomed flask, and the reaction was performed under reflux with a Dean and Stark water separator attached to the flask, until no more water was 5 generated. After the reaction was completed, the product was precipitated from distilled water, to obtain pure compound represented by following Chemical Formula 6a (yield: 45%).

As the reaction catalyst, an acid such as trifluoromethane- sulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or boron trifluoride-etherate sulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or boron trifluoride-etherate may be used instead of toluene-p-sulfonic acid. As a reaction solvent, a non-carbonyl solvent such as tetrahydrofuran may be used instead of benzene.

In a 100 ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.1 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, acrylic acid (0.06 mole), tetrahydro- furan (20 g) and AIBN (0.2 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the poly- mers were precipitated from distilled water or ethyl ether, to obtain the compound of Chemical Formula 6 (yield: 60%).

The image depicts a chemical structure labeled "<Chemical Formula 7>". The polymer chain contains two distinct repeating units, designated as "a" and "b". Unit "a" features a cyclic ether moiety, while unit "b" has a carboxylic acid group.


## EXAMPLE 5

In a 250-ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.3 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, maleic anhydride (0.1 mole), AIBN (0.8 g) and tetrahydrofuran (41 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from ethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to obtain pure compound of Chemical and dried in vacuo to obtain pure compound of Chemical Formula 8 (yield: 80%).

As a polymerization initiator, conventional radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide may be used instead of AIBN (yield: 40% ).
