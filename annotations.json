It is worth mentioning that this experiment is more closely related with classical rather than quantum chaos. The motivation for the present work was born from the idea of laying the foundations of a quantum treatment for optical billiards, named “The Escape Problem”, by presenting the concept of a Transparent Boundary Condition. We consider a “gas of particles” initially conﬁned to a one dimensional box of length L, that are permitted to escape. We ﬁnd the solution of a Quantum Initial Value Problem using a numerical method developed and entirely checked with an exact, analytic method. The numerical method introduces a novel way to solve a Diﬀusion Type Equation by implementing Discrete Transparent Boundary Conditions recently developed by mathematicians."

With the evolution of gΘ known, dynamics of per- turbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ψ through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z ≃0.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of Θ into the coherent evolution of Ψ.

In Fig. 7, ∆ϕl(T ) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1 . . . 4. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature T ≲TN(8), an abrupt drop of ∆ϕ3 and ∆ϕ4, which rapidly reach an almost con- stant value, only slightly larger than ∆ϕ1. In the tem- perature range TN(8) ≲T < TC(8) we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all NN layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-FM conﬁguration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position Qz,max of the structure factor S(0, 0, qz). In Fig. 8 the average of Qz,max vs T is reported, again for n = 8 and for diﬀerent lateral dimen- sions L26. As expected from the previous argument, we see that Qz,max = 0 for TN(8) < T < TC(8), while it be- gins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below TN(8), making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with Qz,max ̸= 0 and reaching a value of about 21◦for T = 10 K."

Since the normal rated thrust condition is a particular design point for the engine, the minimum value of c, will occur at or near this range of RPM. The illustration of figure 2.10 shows a typical vati- ation of c, with percent maximum RPM where values of RPM less than 80 to 85 percent pro- duce a specific fuel consumption much greater than the minimum obtainable. This pref- erence for high.RPM to obtain low values of C, is very pronounced in the fixed geometry engine. Turbojet engines with multispool compressors tend to be less sensitive in this respect and are more flexible in their operating characteristics. Whenever low values of cI ate necessary to obtain range or endurance, the preference of the turboiet engine for the design operating RPM can be a factor of great influence."

An increase in alti- tude then causes the engine air mass flow to decrease in a manner very nearly identical to the altitude density ratio. Of coutsc, this de- crease in mass flow will produce a significant e&ct on the output thrust of the engine. Actually, the variation of thrust with altitude is not quite as severe as the density variation because favorable decreases in temperature occut. The decrease in inlet air temperature will provide a relatively greater combustion gas &ergy and allow a greater jet velocity. The increase in jet velocity somewhat offsets the decrease in mass flow. Of course, an in- crease in altitude provides lower temperatures below the tropopause. Above the tropopause, no further favorable decrease in temperature takes place so a more rapid variation of thrust will take place. The approximate variation of thrust with altitude is represented by figure 2.11 and some typical values at specific alti- tudes ate as follows :"

A horizontal gust produces a change in dynamic pressure on the airplane but causes relatively small and unimportant changes in flight load factor.

The vec- torial addition of the gust velocity to the air- plane velocity causes the change in angle of attack and change in lift. The change in angle of attack at some flight condition causes a change in the flight load factor.

The increase in direct operating costs is primarily attributable to costs associated with operating the increased number of ATMs in the network during the periods. Also, intercompany allocations were made to charge the ATM operations with transaction switching and bank connection fees associated with the operations central processing center in Budapest. These allocations totalled $3.5 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Direct operating costs for 2000 include a one-time gain of $1.2 million due to a change in Hungarian law that eliminates a major portion of the Company’s liability for import taxes on ATM hardware. Direct operating costs also include a $657,000 gain realized in 1999 from the sale of the Croatian network assets.

While the rig count reduction is encouraging, some of the wells drilled prior to the reduction are still waiting upon completion and the remaining active rigs continue to drill away meaning new wells will continue to come online with high flush production so we are unlikely to see a flattening and ultimate reduction in US supply until late this year. The good news is that high initial production rates fade fast so, as long as prices stay relatively low, there is likely to be a material decline in U.S. production (say 8-9%) over the course of 2016."

With reference to FIG. 1, system 10 includes first and second precursor zones 14 and 16, respectively, separated by an interme- diate isolation zone 20 in which an inert fluid is present. The inert fluid may comprise an inert liquid, but more preferably consists essentially of an inert gas, such as nitrogen (N2). When in use, reactive first and second pre- cursor gases (Precursor 1 and Precursor 2) are intro- duced into the respective first and second precursor zones 14,16 from first and second precursor delivery sys- tems 24, 26. Precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clude precursor source containers (not shown) located outside or within precursor zones 14, 16. Additionally or alternatively, precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clude piping, pumps, valves, tanks, and other associated equipment for supplying precursor gases into precursor zones 14, 16. An inert gas delivery system 28 is similarly included for injecting inert gas into isolation zone 20."

In other embodiments, the vessel 30 may have entrance and exit passageways for interfacing with other process modules or equipment, as described below with reference to FIG. 4. A series of first passage- ways 54 through first divider 34 are spaced apart along a general direction of travel of substrate 12, and a cor- responding series of second passageways 56 are pro- vided through second divider 36. The passageways 54, 56 are arranged and configured for substrate 12 to be threaded therethrough back and forth between first and second precursor zones 14,16 multiple times, and each time through isolation zone 20. For a web substrate, pas- sageways 54, 56 preferably comprise slits having a width (exaggerated in FIG. 1) that is slightly greater than the thickness of substrate 12 and a length (not shown) ex- tending into the plane of FIG.1 (i.e., normal to the page) and that is slightly greater than a width of the substrate. Isolation zone 20 is, thus, preferably separated (albeit imperfectly) from the first precursor zone 14 by first di- vider 34 and from second precursor zone 16 by second divider 36."

Pas- sageways 54, 56 are preferably configured to restrict the flow of gases between the zones 14,16, 20, to avoid or limit diffusion of precursor gases into a common zone. Passageways 54, 56 may include slits sized only slightly thicker and wider than the thickness and width of the substrate passing through them, leaving only a very small amount of headroom and margins to allow substrate 12 to pass therethrough without scraping against the sides of the passageways. For example, headroom and mar- gins may range between microns and millimeters in cer- tain embodiments. The passageways 54, 56 may also include elongate tunnels through which the substrate 12 passes, as depicted in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4. Such slits and tunnels are sometimes referred to as slit valves, although no actual moving valve gate is utilized. In some embod- iments, the passageways 54, 56 include a wiper for fur- ther restricting flow. In one such embodiment, the sub- strate is threaded through opposing leaves of resilient material, such as a synthetic rubber, which wipe against opposing surfaces of the substrate."

In such an embodiment, no common inert gas chamber 50 con- nects the passageways, so inert gas is injected directly into the passageways medially of the first and second precursor zones 14,16 to help prevent precursor migra- tion and mixing. Isolation zone 20 of this embodiment would include a manifold, or a number of manifolds, for routing inert gas lines to nozzles along the sides of the passageways. The manifold or manifolds would be formed in the material of the reaction chamber bordering the passageways, and may be connected to an inert gas delivery system along the sides of the system, rather than at an end of the system as shown in FIG. 1."
