5,0,"Queue Prioritization Experiment We tested our method for prioritizing the crawling queue using Bengali language Twitter users. In order to properly compare the various methods we ﬁrst collected a data set of 10,785 Twitter users. (5,684 users came from our search queries and an additional 5,103 came from those users’ social connections.) The way the queue ranking works is to ﬁrst download a small set of users and use that as training data to learn a ranking for the rest of the download queue. We randomly selected 300 users for our training set. The ranking methods were used to order the remaining 10,000+ users in the simulated download queue. In Figure 2, we show the cumulative in-vocabulary tokens obtained as an additional 500 users are processed from the download queue for each of the three prioritization strategies. The predictive ranking provides three times as many in- vocabulary tokens as either the edge count ranking or the random baseline. Figure 3 is similar but shows the cumulative vocabulary coverage (types) where the vocabulary is taken from a held-out dev set different from the text used to produce the Twitter queries. The horizontal line represents the type coverage of the in-domain training data. The predictive ranking covers an additional 10% of the dev-set vocabulary compared to either of the other strategies. More than 53% of the vocabulary types and about 9% of the tokens in the dev- set are not found in the in-domain training data. The Twitter data downloaded using the predictive ranking covers 56% of these previously unseen vocabulary types, substantially out- performing the edge count ranking and the random baseline. The match between the vocabulary of the data obtained with the predictive ranking with the in-domain data is an indication of the value of the predictive ranking strategy.

In Figure 2, we show the cumulative in-vocabulary tokens obtained as an additional 500 users are processed from the download queue for each of the three prioritization strategies. The predictive ranking provides three times as many in-vocabulary tokens as either the edge count ranking or the random baseline. Figure 3 is similar but shows the cumulative vocabulary coverage (types) where the vocabulary is taken from a held-out dev set different from the text used to produce the Twitter queries. The horizontal line represents the type coverage of the in-domain training data. The predictive ranking covers an additional 10% of the dev-set vocabulary compared to either of the other strategies. More than 53% of the vocabulary types and about 9% of the tokens in the dev-set are not found in the in-domain training data. The Twitter data downloaded using the predictive ranking covers 56% of these previously unseen vocabulary types, substantially out-performing the edge count ranking and the random baseline. The match between the vocabulary of the data obtained with the predictive ranking with the in-domain data is an indication of the value of the predictive ranking strategy.

The most important features for the predictive ranking (as measured by the average decrease in node impurity in the random forest regression model) are average number of reverse followers in the training set, average sentence count after filtering among followers in the training set and aver-age sentence count after filtering among mentioners in the training set. Even though edge features highly influence the predictive ranking model, the edge count ranking is worse than the predictive ranking on both of the type coverage and the cumulative IV token metrics. This is because there are high edge count connections from Bengali speaking Twitter users to international celebrities, which fools the edge count ranking strategy but not the random forest regression. (The top followed Twitter user by Bengali speakers is @BarackObama followed by @BillGates.)

We created language models from the downloaded data to compare the effectiveness of the ranking strategies. The language models used the data from the 300 users in the training set as well as the additional users selected by each of the respective ranking strategies. Table VI lists the resulting perplexities on the held-out in-domain data.

An increase in altitude produces a decrease in density and pressure and, if below the tropopause, a decrease in temperature. If a typical nonafterburning turbojet engine is operated at a constant RPM and true airspeed, the variation of thrust and specific fuel consumption with altitude can be approximated from figure 2.11. The variation of density in the standard atmosphere is shown by the values of density ratio at various altitudes. Typical values of the density ratio at specific altitudes are as follows:",0.0823019801980198,"
due to the low combustion pressure and values of c<sub>t</sub> from 2.0 to 4.0 are typical with afterburner operation.

The turbojet engine usually has a strong preference for high RPM to produce low specific fuel consumption. Since the normal rated thrust condition is a particular design point for the engine, the minimum value of c<sub>t</sub> will occur at or near this range of RPM. The variation of c<sub>t</sub> with percent maximum RPM where values of RPM less than 80 to 85 percent produce a specific fuel consumption much greater than the minimum obtainable. This preference for high RPM to obtain low values of c<sub>t</sub> is very pronounced in the fixed geometry engine. Turbojet engines with multispool compressors tend to be less sensitive in this respect and are more flexible in their operating characteristics. Whenever low values of c<sub>t</sub> are necessary to obtain range or endurance, the preference of the turbojet engine for the design operating RPM can be a factor of great influence.

35,0,"As illustrated, at high gross weights above the basic configuration weight, the limit and ulti- mate load factors may be seriously reduced. For the airplane shown, a 5-g maneuver im- mediately after a high gross weight takeoff could be very near the “disaster regime,” especially if turbulence is associated with the maneuver.

* acquiring new exploration acreage
* adding material exploration prospects
* drilling wildcat exploration wells.

**SUCCESS RATE OF 44% IN 2004**

Santos' 2004 exploration effort produced good results, as the Company high graded its exploration acreage and started drilling one of the most exciting portfolios in the industry.

Santos discovered hydrocarbons in seven of the sixteen wildcat wells that were drilled, achieving an impressive success rate of 44%.

The program added at least 93 million boe (including the pre-drill estimate for Jeruk) of recoverable resources that will be further evaluated by delineation and, in some cases, production history to determine 1P and 2P reserve additions.

Importantly, these results were achieved with financial discipline, spending $126 million which was substantially less than forecast.

The most significant drilling result for the year was the Jeruk oil discovery in the Sampang PSC offshore East Java, Indonesia. The Jeruk discovery is still under evaluation but its commercial significance appears encouraging. Santos has confirmed an oil column of at least 379 metres with a likely gross recoverable resource in excess of the pre-drill estimate of 170 million barrels.

Santos also had further exploration successes in the

Cooper Basin in central Australia where four of six wildcat wells were cased and suspended as gas discoveries.

There was also success in the offshore Otway Basin with the Martha gas discovery near the Casino field, which is currently being evaluated to determine its commercial significance. Additional drilling is planned to occur nearby in 2005 to follow up this encouraging result.

production by D&amp;P investments of $244 million. Through $26 million of direct mineral leases and $36 million of acquisitions in 2014, the Company increased its Eagle Ford acreage position to 20,742 net acres, which represents 153.7 net undrilled 3P Reserves locations.

Since its entrance into the Eagle Ford in March 2013, the Company has:

- increased its production over 10x to a 2014 exit rate of 8,177 BOEPD (a 290 percent CAGR);
- increased 1P Constant Case Reserves by 10x to 18,132 MBOE (PV10 of $449.3 million (an 18x increase));
- increased its acreage to approximately 33,000 net acres, primarily in the volatile oil and condensate window of the Eagle Ford (includes 14,180 net acres acquired in January 2015 and excludes 5,418 net acres targeting the Georgetown Formation in neighboring Maverick County);

· increased its producing well count to 77 gross (53.8 net), with an additional 19 gross (10.6 net) wells in progress at year-end; · increased its undrilled 3P Reserves drilling locations to 153.7 net; which represents a 4.3 year drilling inventory (assuming two rig program drilling 36 net wells per year and 40-80 acre spacing)
