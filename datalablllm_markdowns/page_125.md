In formula (F2), Rx represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As preferred substituents that the alkyl group represented by Rx may have, a hydroxyl group and a halogen atom are exemplified.

Fa represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched alkylene group, and preferably a single bond.

Fb represents a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon group.

Fc represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched  $20$ alkylene group, and preferably a single bond or a methylene group.

 $F_1$  represents a group represented by formula (F1).

 $P_1$  represents from 1 to 3.

As the cyclic hydrocarbon group represented by Fb, a  $\,^{25}$ cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, or a norbornyl group is preferred.

The specific examples of the repeating units having the structure represented by formula  $(F1)$  are shown below.

The alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin in the invention can contain various kinds of repeating structural units, besides the above repeating structural units, for the purpose of the adjustments of dry etching resistance, aptitude for standard developing solutions, adhesion to a substrate,  $_{60}$ resist profile, and further, general requisite performances of resists, e.g., resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity.

As these repeating structural units, the repeating structural units corresponding to the monomers shown below can be exemplified, but the invention is not restricted thereto.

By containing such various repeating structural units, fine adjustment of performances required of the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin, in particular the following performances, becomes possible, that is,

(1) Solubility in a coating solvent,

(2) A film-forming property (a glass transition point),

(3) Alkali developability,

(4) Decrease of layer thickness (hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, selection of an alkali-soluble group),

(5) Adhesion of an unexposed area to a substrate, and

(6) Dry etching resistance.

The examples of such monomers include compounds having one addition polymerizable unsaturated bond selected from acrylic esters, methacrylic esters, acrylamides, methacryl-amides, allyl compounds, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, etc.

In addition to the aforementioned compounds, addition polymerizable unsaturated compounds copolymerizable with the monomers corresponding to the above various repeating structural units may be used for copolymerization.

In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin, the molar ratio of the content of each repeating structural unit is arbitrarily set to adjust dry etching resistance, aptitude for standard developing solutions of a resist, adhesion to a substrate, and resist profile, in addition, general requisite performances of a resist, e.g., resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity.

As preferred embodiments of the alicyclic hydrocarbonbased acid-decomposable resin in the invention, the follow- $_{30}$  ing resins are exemplified.

 $(1)$  Resin containing a repeating unit having a partial structure containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of formulae (pI) to (pV) (a side chain type), preferably resin containing a repeating unit by (meth)acrylate having the 35 structure of any of formulae  $(pI)$  to  $(pV)$ ,

(2) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula (II-AB) (a main chain type); however, the following is further exemplified as embodiment  $(2)$ ,

(3) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula (II-AB), a maleic anhydride derivative structure and a (meth) acrylate structure (a hybrid type).

In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin, the content of a repeating unit having an acid-decom-45 posable group is preferably from 10 to 60 mol % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 20 to 50 mol %, and still more preferably from 25 to 40 mol %.

In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin, the content of a repeating unit having a partial structure 50 containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of formulae (pI) to  $(pV)$  is preferably from 25 to 70 mol % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 35 to 65 mol %, and still more preferably from 40 to 60 mol %.

In the alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable 55 resin, the content of a repeating unit represented by formula (II-AB) is preferably from 10 to 60 mol  $\%$  in the total repeating structural units, more preferably from 15 to 55 mol %, and still more preferably from 20 to 50 mol %.

The content of the repeating unit having a lactone group is preferably from 10 to 70 mol  $\%$  in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 20 to 60 mol %, and still more preferably from 25 to 60 mol %.

The content of the repeating unit having the alicyclic hydrocarbon structure substituted with a polar group is preferably from 1 to 40 mol % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 5 to 30 mol %, and still more preferably from 5 to 20 mol %.
