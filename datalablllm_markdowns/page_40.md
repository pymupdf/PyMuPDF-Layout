# MISSED APPROACH INFORMATION

Missed approach information is shown in 3 locations on the chart:

- The Middle Briefing Strip The complete textual missed approach instructions are provided at the top of the approach chart in the middle pilot briefing strip.
- The Planview The missed approach track is drawn using a thin, hash marked line with a directional arrow. If the . missed approach fix is off the chart, the missed approach track shall extend to the chart border.

 $\cdots\cdots\cdots\cdots\blacktriangleright$ Missed Approach

The Profile Box - Missed Approach Icons will be depicted in the upper left or upper right of the profile box. The Missed Approach Icons are intended to provide quick, at a glance intuitive guidance to the pilot, to supplement the textual missed approach instructions in the briefing strip. Space permitting, all textual missed approach instructions will be graphically depicted in sequence. If space does not permit the depiction of all missed approach icons, only the first four icon boxes will be shown.
