where t 0 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + w ≤ b k +1 ≤ b k . Consequently, the sharp upper bound is written as follows: letting F U ∆ ,W ( δ | w ) be the sharp upper bound on Pr ( Y 1 -Y 0 ≤ δ | W = w ) ,

## Appendix B

Appendix B presents the procedure used to compute the sharp lower bound under MTR in Section 4 and Section 5. The following lemma is useful for reducing computational costs:

## Lemma B.1 Let

It is innocuous to assume that { a k } ∞ k = -∞ satisfies a k +2 -a k &gt; δ for each integer k .

Proof. I will show that for any sequence { a k } ∞ k = -∞ ∈ A δ satisfying a k +2 -a k ≤ δ for some integer k, one can construct { ˜ a k } ∞ k = -∞ ∈ A δ with ˜ a k +2 -˜ a k &gt; δ for each integer k and
