## &lt;Other Components&gt;

[0317] The composition of the present invention may fur› ther  contain  a  photo-acid  generator,  a  basic  compound,  a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an anti› oxidant, a  solvent  and  the  like.  These  components  are described below.

## (Photo-Acid Generator)

[0318] The composition of the present invention may fur› ther contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeat› ing unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating  an acid upon  irradiation with an actinic  ray  or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-dis› coloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like,  and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as  sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred  examples  of the  photo-acid  generator include compounds represented by the following  formulae (ZI),  (ZII) and (ZIII):
