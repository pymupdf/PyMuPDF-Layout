The function ϕ can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum B k = ( -∞ , b k ) with b k +1 ≤ b k and b k ∈ [ -∞ , ∞ ] for every integer k . By Theorem 1, for δ &gt; 0 , B D k is written as

Note that Y 1 = Y 0 + δ and Y 1 = t 1 -t W t 0 -t W Y 0 -t 1 -t 0 t 0 -t W w intersect at ( t 0 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + y -1 , t 1 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + w ) . I consider the following three cases: a) b k +1 ≤ b k ≤ t 0 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + w, b) b k +1 ≤ t 0 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + w ≤ b k , and c) t 0 -t W t 1 -t 0 δ + w ≤ b k +1 ≤ b k .
