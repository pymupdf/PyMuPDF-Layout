Note that /epsilon1 1 , 2 , 3 are all proportional to X which contains a double suppression factor. This feature was the main ingredient for the compatibility of the D-BESS model with the EW precision tests. In the five dimensional formulation of this model the ratio ( g/ ¯ g 5 ) 2 originates from the presence of brane localized kinetic terms.

The /epsilon1 parameters can be tested against the experimental data. To do this, we need to express the model parameters in terms of the physical quantities. Proceeding again as in [60] we get the expressions the standard input parameters α , G F and m Z in terms of the model parameters. For convenience we rewrite the results:

In section VI, we will study the constraints on the model parameter space by EW precision parameter for two choices of the warp factor, b ( y ) ≡ 1 (flat extra dimension) and b ( y ) = e -2 ky (a slice of AdS 5 ). To this aim we need to invert (73), (74) and (75),

then, using definitions (65), obtain also ˜ g and ˜ g ′ .
