The fourth set of observational data is 12 Hubble evolution data from [21] and [22], its χ 2 H is defined as

Note that redshifts of these data fall in the region z ∈ (0 , 1 . 75).

## IV. FITTING RESULTS

## A. Model I

At first, we divide the whole region of redshift into 4 bins (i.e., m = 3), the divided points and boundaries are (0 , z 1 , z 2 , 1 . 8 , ∞ ), where z 1 and z 2 are left as free parameters of the model, and 0 &lt; z 1 &lt; z 2 &lt; 1 . 8. In the fourth bin we set w L = -1. It means that we divide the region with z ∈ (0 , 1 . 8) into 3 bins and seek for two possible turning points of w de ( z ) in this region. The reconstructed w de of the best-fitted model is shown in Fig. 1,
