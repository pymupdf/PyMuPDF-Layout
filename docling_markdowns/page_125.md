In formula (F2), Rx represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. As preferred substituents that the alkyl group represented by Rx may have, a hydroxyl group and a halogen atom are exempli› fied.

Fa represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched alkylene group, and preferably a single bond.

- Fb  represents  a  monocyclic  or  polycyclic  hydrocarbon group.

Fe represents a single bond or a straight chain or branched alkylene group, and preferably a single bond or a methylene group.

- F 1 represents a group represented by formula (F 1).
- P1 represents from 1 to 3.
- As  the  cyclic  hydrocarbon  group  represented  by  Fb,  a cyclopentyl group, a cyclohexyl group, or a norbomyl group is preferred.

The  specific  examples  of the  repeating  units  having  the structure represented by formula (Fl) are shown below.

The alicyclic hydrocarbon-based acid-decomposable resin in the invention can contain various kinds of  repeating struc› tural units, besides the above repeating structural units, for the purpose of  the adjustments of  dry etching resistance, aptitude for  standard developing  solutions,  adhesion to  a  substrate, resist profile, and further,  general requisite performances of resists, e.g., resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity.

As these repeating structural units, the repeating structural units  corresponding to  the monomers  shown below can be exemplified, but the invention is not restricted thereto.

By containing such various repeating structural units, fine adjustment of performances required of  the alicyclic hydro-

carbon-based acid-decomposable resin, in particular the fol› lowing performances, becomes possible, that is,

- (1) Solubility in a coating solvent,
- (2) A film-forming property (a glass transition point),
- (3) Alkali developability,
- (4)  Decrease  of layer  thickness  (hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, selection of  an alkali-soluble group),
- (5) Adhesion of  an unexposed area to a substrate, and

## (6) Dry etching resistance.

The examples of  such monomers include compounds hav› ing  one  addition  polymerizable  unsaturated  bond  selected from acrylic  esters,  methacrylic  esters,  acrylamides,  meth› acryl-amides, ally! compounds, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, etc.

In addition  to  the  aforementioned  compounds,  addition polymerizable unsaturated compounds copolymerizable with the monomers corresponding to the above various repeating structural units may be used for copolymerization.

In  the  alicyclic  hydrocarbon-based  acid-decomposable resin, the molar ratio of  the content of each repeating struc› tural  unit is  arbitrarily  set  to  adjust dry etching resistance, aptitude for standard developing solutions of a resist, adhesion to  a  substrate,  and  resist  profile,  in  addition,  general requisite performances of  a resist, e.g., resolution, heat resis› tance and sensitivity.

As preferred embodiments of the alicyclic hydrocarbon› based acid-decomposable resin in the invention, the following resins are exemplified.

(1) Resin containing a repeating unit having a partial structure containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of formulae  (pl)  to  (pV)  (a  side  chain type),  preferably  resin containing  a  repeating  unit  by  (meth)acrylate  having  the structure of  any of  formulae (pl) to (p  V),

- (2) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula (II-AB) (a main chain type); however, the following is further exemplified as embodiment (2),

(3) Resin containing a repeating unit represented by formula (II-AB), a maleic anhydride derivative structure and a (meth) acrylate structure (a hybrid type).

In  the  alicyclic  hydrocarbon-based  acid-decomposable resin, the content of a repeating unit having an acid-decomposable group is preferably from  10 to  60 mo! % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 20 to 50 mo! %, and still more preferably from 25 to 40 mo! %.

In  the  alicyclic  hydrocarbon-based  acid-decomposable resin, the content of  a repeating unit having a partial structure containing the alicyclic hydrocarbon represented by any of formulae (pl) to (p  V) is preferably from 25 to 70 mo! % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 35 to 65 mo! %, and still more preferably from 40 to 60 mo! %.

The content of  the repeating unit having a lactone group is preferably from 10 to 70 mo! % in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 20 to  60 mo!  %,  and still more preferably from 25 to 60 mo! %.

The  content  of the  repeating  unit  having  the  alicyclic hydrocarbon structure substituted with a polar group is preferably from 1 to 40 mo!% in all the repeating structural units, more preferably from 5 to 30 mo!%, and still more preferably from 5 to 20 mo! %.
