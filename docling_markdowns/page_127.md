[0291] Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably a  photoacid  generator  including  an  anionic  moiety  and  a cationic  moiety  from  the  viewpoint  that  the  effect  of the present invention is  more excellent.

[0292] More specifically, the photoacid generator is  pref› erably a compound represented by General Formula (ZI) or General Formula (ZII).

[0293] In General Formula (ZI),

[0294] R201 ,  R202 ,  and R 203 each independently represent an organic group.

[0295] The number of carbon atoms of the organic group as  each of R 201 , R202 ,  and R203 is  preferably 1 to  30,  and more preferably 1 to  20.

[0296] Furthermore, two ofR 201 to R 203 may be bonded to each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include an  oxygen  atom,  a  sulfur  atom,  an  ester  bond,  an  amide bond,  or  a  carbonyl  group,  and  examples  of the  group formed  by the bonding  of two  of R 201 to  R 203 include  an alkylene group  (for example,  a  butylene group  and a  pen› tylene group).

[0297] zrepresents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion hav› ing  a  remarkably  low  ability  of  causing  a  nucleophilic reaction).

[0298] Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a sulfonate  anion  (such  as  an  aliphatic  sulfonate  anion,  an aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an aromatic  carboxylate  anion, and  an  aralkyl  carboxylate anion), a  sulfonylimide  anion, a  bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide anion,  and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion.

[0299] The  aliphatic  moiety  in  the  aliphatic sulfonate anion and the aliphatic  carboxylate anion may be an alkyl group  or a  cycloalkyl  group,  and  is  preferably  a  linear  or branched  alkyl  group  having 1 to  30  carbon  atoms  or  a cycloalkyl group having 3 to  30 carbon atoms.

[0300] As  the  aromatic  ring  group  in  the  aromatic  sul› fonate  anion  and  the  aromatic  carboxylate  anion,  an  aryl group  having  6  to 14 carbon  atoms  is  preferable,  and examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and a naphthyl group.

[0301] Specific examples of the substituent which may be contained in the alkyl group, the cycloalkyl group,  and the aryl  group  exemplified  above  include  a  nitro group, a halogen  atom  such  as  fluorine  atom,  a  carboxyl  group,  a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a cyano group,  an alkoxy group (preferably having 1 to  15 carbon atoms), a cycloalkyl group  (preferably  having  3  to  15  carbon  atoms),  an  aryl group (preferably having 6 to 14 carbon atoms), an alkoxy› carbonyl group (preferably having 2 to  7 carbon atoms), an acyl  group  (preferably  having  2  to  12  carbon  atoms),  an alkoxycarbonyloxy group  (preferably having 2 to  7 carbon atoms), an alkylthio group (preferably having 1 to  15 carbon atoms),  an alkylsulfonyl  group  (preferably having 1 to  15 carbon  atoms), an  alkyliminosulfonyl  group (preferably having 1 to  15  carbon  atoms),  an  aryloxysulfonyl  group (preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyl aryloxy› sulfonyl group (preferably having 7 to 20 carbon atoms),  a cycloalkylaryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 10 to 20 carbon atoms),  an alkyloxyalkyloxy group  (preferably hav› ing 5 to 20 carbon atoms), and a cycloalkylalkyloxyalkyloxy group  (preferably having  8 to  20 carbon atoms).
