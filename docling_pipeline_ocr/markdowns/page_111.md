In Formula (A-1 ), RA 1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group.

If n  is  2  or more, RA 2 's each independently represents a substituent.

A represents  a  single bond or a divalent linking group. Z  represents  a  atomic  group  forming  a  monocyclid  or polycyclic  structure  together  with  a  group  represented  by

-O----C(=O)-O- in the formula.

n represents  an integer of 0 or more.

Formula (A-1) will be described in detail.

The alkyl group represented by RA 1 may have a substitu› ent  such  as  a  fluorine  atom. RA 1 represents  preferably  a hydrogen atom,  a methyl  group  or a  trifluormethyl  group, and more preferably a methyl group.

The  substituent  represented  by RA 2 is,  for  example,  an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxycarbonylamino group. The substituent is  preferably an alkyl  group  having  1 to  5 carbon atoms,  for example,  a straight alkyl group having  1 to  5 carbon atoms  such as  a methyl  group,  an ethyl  group, a  propyl  group  and  a  butyl  group;  and  a  branched  alkyl group  having  3  to  5  carbon  atoms  such  as  an  isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and at-butyl group. An alkyl group may have a substituent such as  a hydroxyl group.

n represents the number of substituents, and is  an integer of 0 or more. For example, n is preferably Oto 4,  and more preferably 0.

Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by  65 A may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond, an  urea  bond,  or  combination  thereof.  Examples  of the alkylene  group  may  include  preferably  an  alkylene  group having  1 to  10 carbon atoms,  more preferably an alkylene group  having  1  to 5  carbon  atoms,  and  for  example  a methylene  group,  an  ethylene  group,  an propylene  group, and the like.

In one aspect of the present invention, A is  preferably a single bond,  or an alkylene group.

The  moncyclic  group  containing  ---O-C(=O)---0-, represented by Z is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which nA=2 to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the  following  Formula  (a),  and  preferably  a  5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring (nA=2 or 3), and more preferably a  5-membered ring (nA=2).

The  polycyclic  group  containing  -O----C(=O)-O› represented by Z may, for example, be a structure in which a  cyclic  carbonate ester represented by the following  Formula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of  forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclid hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydro› carbon group or a heterocyclic ring.

The monomer corresponding to  the repeating unit repre› sented by Formula (A-1) may be synthesized by a conven› tionally known method described in,  for example, Tetrahe› dron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 32 p. 3741(1986), Organic Letters, Vol.  4,  No.  15  p.  2561(2002),  and the  like.

In the resin (A), the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be contained either alone or in a combination of two  or more thereof.

Hereinafter,  specific  examples of the repeating unit hav› ing a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is  not limited thereto.

In addition, RA 1 in the following specific examples has the same meaning as  RA 1 in Formula (A-1).
