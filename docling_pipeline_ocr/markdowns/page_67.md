- Make sure that you focus on answering the question - only include relevant information, and remember to present logical arguments in support of your answer.

8. Proofread your assignment before handing it in. Tip: read your answers out loud to make sure that they sound logical.

9. Always keep a copy or electronic backup of your assignment.

This way, you won't have to start over if your computer crashes,  or redo the whole assignment if the original goes missing.

## 10. When you get your assignment back from your tutor: Read through the feedback, and learn from your mistakes. This will

help you to prepare for your exams (if you have to write them), as well as to help you achieve better marks in future assignments.
