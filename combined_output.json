The details of centralized scheme A are presented in Algorithm 2. Centralized Scheme A: Complexity Analysis The initial allocation phase has a complexity of O(KN2) which is the same as Algorithm 1. Next, we perform a one dimensional search for the user in cell l with maximum incremental throughput at subcarrier n. The process is repeated for each subcarrier and cell. Thus, the com- putational complexity of this step is O(KNL). Since, the process continues until convergence, (i.e., M iterations), the complexity of this step can be written as O(KNLM). Finally, the total complexity of subcarrier allocation phase is O(KN2 + NKLM). The complexity of Phase II is dif\ufb01cult to determine, however, it can be measured in terms of the degree of dif\ufb01culty (DoD) that in turn relies on the number of constraints and variables associated with the GP [15]. Since we are dealing with LK power constraints and LKN power variables, the total computational complexity of centralized scheme A is O(KN2 + NKLM) + DoD(LKN).

In recent years, several approaches to extract s- SWNTs from nanotube powders were explored using for instance chemical functionalization,9\u201311 DNA and polymers wrapping,12,13 and density gradient ultra- centrifugation techniques.6 The latter e\ufb03ciently sepa- rates s-SWNTs and m-SWNTs, but traces of surfactant and density gradient materials limit the performances of the FET. Very recently, two groups have reported on the selective extraction of near-armchair s-SWNTs from nanotube powders using poly\ufb02uorene as extracting agent.14,15 According to Nish et al.,14 the sample shows no detectable traces of m-SWNTs based only on optical spectroscopy. However, neither the electrical properties nor the fabrication of FET devices were addressed. In this letter, we report on the electronic properties of FET consisting of semiconducting-enriched single wall carbon nanotubes, without detectable traces of metallic nanotubes and impurities, with in our detection limits. This unprecedented achievement is made possible by ul- tracentrifugation (250,000g), sonication and \ufb01ltration of solutions composed of SWNT powders with poly\ufb02uorene as extracting agent in toluene.

Re- cently, in 2001, a group at the University of Texas introduced an experimental set up for modeling the wedge billiard geometry called optical billiard in two dimensions.

The motivation for the present work was born from the idea of laying the foundations of a quantum treatment for optical billiards, named \u201cThe Escape Problem\u201d, by presenting the concept of a Transparent Boundary Condition.

      "reading_order_1": "Queue Prioritization Experiment We tested our method for prioritizing the crawling queue using Bengali language Twitter users. In order to properly compare the various methods we \ufb01rst collected a data set of 10,785 Twitter users. (5,684 users came from our search queries and an additional 5,103 came from those users\u2019 social connections.) The way the queue ranking works is to \ufb01rst download a small set of users and use that as training data to learn a ranking for the rest of the download queue. We randomly selected 300 users for our training set. The ranking methods were used to order the remaining 10,000+ users in the simulated download queue. In Figure 2, we show the cumulative in-vocabulary tokens obtained as an additional 500 users are processed from the download queue for each of the three prioritization strategies. The predictive ranking provides three times as many in- vocabulary tokens as either the edge count ranking or the random baseline. Figure 3 is similar but shows the cumulative vocabulary coverage (types) where the vocabulary is taken from a held-out dev set different from the text used to produce the Twitter queries. The horizontal line represents the type coverage of the in-domain training data. The predictive ranking covers an additional 10% of the dev-set vocabulary compared to either of the other strategies. More than 53% of the vocabulary types and about 9% of the tokens in the dev- set are not found in the in-domain training data. The Twitter data downloaded using the predictive ranking covers 56% of these previously unseen vocabulary types, substantially out- performing the edge count ranking and the random baseline. The match between the vocabulary of the data obtained with the predictive ranking with the in-domain data is an indication of the value of the predictive ranking strategy. The most important features for the predictive ranking (as measured by the average decrease in node impurity in the random forest regression model) are average number of reverse followers in the training set, average sentence count after \ufb01ltering among followers in the training set and aver- age sentence count after \ufb01ltering among mentioners in the training set. Even though edge features highly in\ufb02uence the predictive ranking model, the edge count ranking is worse than the predictive ranking on both of the type coverage and the cumulative IV token metrics. This is because there are high edge count connections from Bengali speaking Twitter users to international celebrities, which fools the edge count ranking strategy but not the random forest regression. (The top followed Twitter user by Bengali speakers is @BarackObama followed by @BillGates.) We created language models from the downloaded data to compare the effectiveness of the ranking strategies. The language models used the data from the 300 users in the training set as well as the additional users selected by each of the respective ranking strategies. Table VI lists the resulting perplexities on the held-out in-domain data. The predictive ranking LM achieved a 17% reduction in perplexity over the random baseline after downloading 500 users from the queue. When less than 500 additional users are downloaded, the predictive ranking has a better perplexity than the edge"

In doing the SVD, we select the dominant pmodes to con- tribute to the \u03c72 by requiring that \u03bb2 > 2/Njk. In Figure 4, we rank the eigenvalues (\u03bbi) for the in- creasing eigenmodes and see a \u201ckink\u201d in the distribu- tion which we interpret as indicating a transition in the signal\u2013to\u2013noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the \ufb01rst ten modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered modes are dominated by noise. We therefore remove eigenmodes beyond this kink (with \u03bbi < 0.01) where the eigenvalues start to \ufb02atten out. Statistical determination of large scale \ufb02ow As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evi- dence for excessive bulk \ufb02ow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalised \u039bCDM model [18] and therefore, it is important to con\ufb01rm these results as it may indicate evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modi\ufb01ed gravity. In this pa- per, we provide a \ufb01rst demonstration of our new param- eterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In detail, we attempt to model the \u201csquashing\u201d of the 2- D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical er- rors, due to a signi\ufb01cant shot\u2013noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger con- straints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk \ufb02ow measurements in the literature. In Figure 5, we provide the best \ufb01t parameters b and vp for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation be- tween these two parameters because the anisotropic am- plitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity \ufb01elds. The best \ufb01t value from Fig- ure 5 is vp = 270+433 km/s (at the 1\u03c3 level marginalised with other parameters including b) and is consistent with vp = 0. We do not quote the negative bound of the error on vp as it is below zero and thus has no physical mean- ing. Instead, we quote the upper bound on vp and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of vp is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a WMAP5\u2013normalised \u039bCDM model. We propose above that vp is a complementary param- eter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter g\u0398, which is equivalent to f\u03c38, is not de- termined precisely without the prior information of AS. But when we report our measurement with vp, there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to g\u2217\u0398 determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value vp at a given redshift is not only in- dependent of bias but also independent of normalisation. B. Reconstruction of matter density \ufb01eld from vp We convert vp measurement into g\u0398 using As from WMAP5 (g\u0398: coherent growth factor of peculiar veloc- ity, and it is equivalent to f\u03c38 in other parameteriza- tions). With the evolution of g\u0398 known, dynamics of per- turbations are reconstructed to provide the history of \u03a8 through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z \u22430.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of \u0398 into the coherent evolution of \u03a8. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coher- ent evolution of \u03a6, g\u03a6. We are able to determine matter density \ufb02uctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coher- ent growth of \u03b4m, g\u03b4 = 0.7, which is related to g\u03a6 as"

The bene\ufb01t of using word classes is that the resulting language model can have fewer parameters than a word-based n-gram model. In our case, the in-domain training text is so small that it can be a real advantage to have fewer parameters to learn in the language model. The problem is that if the data is too small to reliably estimate word transition probabilities (p(wi|wi\u22121)), then it will also be dif\ufb01cult to learn a good partitioning of the words into classes. Our hypothesis is that the advantage in learning the word class assignments on the Twitter data, which solves the data sparsity problem, outweighs any performance penalty that is incurred due to domain mis-match. This differs from the traditional approach where the class assignments (wi \u2208cj) are learned from the same training text which is used to estimate the class transition probabilities (p(ci|ci\u22121)) and the word probabilities (p(wi|cj)). Twitter data, in these experiments, refers to the concatenation of the text downloaded from Twitter with our in-domain data for the reasons described above. The experiments in Section IV-C will compare learning the class assignments on out-of-domain data (hybrid method) to the traditional approach (baseline). IV. EXPERIMENTS A. Experimental Data The in-domain data used in the experiments in this paper comes from the IARPA Babel program.1 This program focuses on keyword search for low-resource languages. The languages are low resource in the sense that they have fewer native speakers than the languages receiving the most attention from researchers and also in the sense that the provided training data is small in comparison to what is typically used. We exclusively focused on the so-called limited language pack, which consists of only ten hours of recorded telephone conver- sations. Our experiments were conducted using the Bengali, Tamil, Turkish and Zulu languages. The languages that we selected for our experiments have the largest vocabulary sizes (See Table I) of the languages in the Babel program and thus suffer the most from the data sparsity problem. As a point of comparison, Tagalog, which was not used in our experiments, has one third as many vocabulary items as Tamil.",

      "reading_order_1": "For this purpose, we look at the temperature depen- dence of the rotation angle of the magnetization between NN planes. In Fig. 7, \u2206\u03d5l(T ) for n = 8 and n = 16 (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, l = 1 . . . 4. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all l, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for n = 8 we see, starting from a temperature T \u2272TN(8), an abrupt drop of \u2206\u03d53 and \u2206\u03d54, which rapidly reach an almost con- stant value, only slightly larger than \u2206\u03d51. In the tem- perature range TN(8) \u2272T < TC(8) we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all NN layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-FM con\ufb01guration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position Qz,max of the structure factor S(0, 0, qz). In Fig. 8 the average of Qz,max vs T is reported, again for n = 8 and for di\ufb00erent lateral dimen- sions L26. As expected from the previous argument, we see that Qz,max = 0 for TN(8) < T < TC(8), while it be- gins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below TN(8), making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with Qz,max \u0338= 0 and reaching a value of about 21\u25e6for T = 10 K. In a previous study, where the magnetic properties of Ho thin \ufb01lms were investigated by MC simulations of a Heisenberg model with easy-plane single-ion anisotropy and six out-of-plane coupling constants (as obtained by experimental neutron scattering measurements16) on a HCP lattice14,15, it was found that for thicknesses compa- rable with the helical pitch the phase diagram landscape is quite di\ufb00erent from what we \ufb01nd here. Indeed, for n = 9 \u221216, three di\ufb00erent magnetic phases could be sin- gled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layers blocks coexist with some inner dis- ordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the sig- natures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one. The absence of the block phase in the J1 \u2212J2 model here investigated has to be attributed to the di\ufb00erent range of interactions, rather than to the di\ufb00erent lattice structure. We came to this conclusion by doing some simulations using the same set of interaction constants employed in Refs. 14,15, but using a BCT lattice: the results we obtained for \u2206\u03d5l with n = 12 are reported in Fig. 9. The latter is absolutely similar to Fig.7 of Ref. 15 and clearly displays the footmarks of the block phase (see down-triangle), with two external blocks of ordered layers ( l =1. . . 5 and 8. . . 12 ), where \u2206\u03d5l is roughly 10\u25e6, sep- arated by a block of disordered layers, and with almost"

Since the normal rated thrust condition is a particular design point for the engine, the minimum value of c, will occur at or near this range of RPM. The illustration of figure 2.10 shows a typical vati- ation of c, with percent maximum RPM where values of RPM less than 80 to 85 percent pro- duce a specific fuel consumption much greater than the minimum obtainable. This pref- erence for high.RPM to obtain low values of C, is very pronounced in the fixed geometry engine. Turbojet engines with multispool compressors tend to be less sensitive in this respect and are more flexible in their operating characteristics. Whenever low values of cI ate necessary to obtain range or endurance, the preference of the turboiet engine for the design operating RPM can be a factor of great influence. Altitude is one factor which strongly affects the performance of the turbojet engine. An increase in altitude produces a decrease in density and pressure and, if below the tropo- pause, a decrease in temperature. If a typical nonaftcrbutning turbojet engine is operated at a constant RPM and true airspeed, the vatia- tion of thtust and specific fuel consumption with altitude can be approximated from figure 221. The variation of density in the standard atmosphere is shown by the values of density ratio at vatious altitudes. Typical values of the density ratio at specific altitudes are as follows:",
      "reading_order_2": "If the fixed geometry engine is operated at a constant V (TAS) in subsonic flight and con- stant N (RPM) the inlet velocity, inlet ram, and compressor pressure ratio are essentially constant with altitude. An increase in alti- tude then causes the engine air mass flow to decrease in a manner very nearly identical to the altitude density ratio. Of coutsc, this de- crease in mass flow will produce a significant e&ct on the output thrust of the engine. Actually, the variation of thrust with altitude is not quite as severe as the density variation because favorable decreases in temperature occut. The decrease in inlet air temperature will provide a relatively greater combustion gas &ergy and allow a greater jet velocity. The increase in jet velocity somewhat offsets the decrease in mass flow. Of course, an in- crease in altitude provides lower temperatures below the tropopause. Above the tropopause, no further favorable decrease in temperature takes place so a more rapid variation of thrust will take place. The approximate variation of thrust with altitude is represented by figure 2.11 and some typical values at specific alti- tudes ate as follows :",

Also note that the thrust at 35,000 ft. is approximately 39 percent of the sea level value. The thrust added by the afterburner of a turbojet engine is not affected so greatly by altitude as the basic engine thrust. The use of afterburner may provide a thrust increase of 50 percent at low altitude or as much as 100 per- cent at high altitude."

      "reading_order_1": "As illustrated, at high gross weights above the basic configuration weight, the limit and ulti- mate load factors may be seriously reduced. For the airplane shown, a 5-g maneuver im- mediately after a high gross weight takeoff could be very near the \u201cdisaster regime,\u201d especially if turbulence is associated with the maneuver. In the same sense, this airplane at very low operating weights below that of the basic configuration would experience great- ly increased limit and ultimate load factors. Operation in this region of high load factors at .low gross weight may create the impression that the airplane has great excess strength capability. This effect must be understood and intelligently appreciated since it is not uncom- mon to have a modern airplane configuration with more than SO percent of its gross weight as fuel. GUST LOAD FACTORS. Gusts are asso- ciated with the vertical and horizontal velocity gradients in the atmosphere. A horizontal gust produces a change in dynamic pressure on the airplane but causes relatively small and unimportant changes in flight load factor. The more important gusts are the vertical gusts which cause changes in angle of attack. This process is illustrated in figure 5.2. The vec- torial addition of the gust velocity to the air- plane velocity causes the change in angle of attack and change in lift. The change in angle of attack at some flight condition causes a change in the flight load factor. The incre- ment change in load factor due to the vertical gust can be determined from the following equation:"

During the past four years Santos has been working to build exploration opportunities by: \u2022 acquiring new exploration acreage \u2022 adding material exploration prospects \u2022 drilling wildcat exploration wells. SUCCESS RATE OF 44% IN 2004 Santos\u2019 2004 exploration effort produced good results, as the Company high graded its exploration acreage and started drilling one of the most exciting portfolios in the industry. Santos discovered hydrocarbons in seven of the sixteen wildcat wells that were drilled, achieving an impressive success rate of 44%. The program added at least 93 million boe (including the pre-drill estimate for Jeruk) of recoverable resources that will be further evaluated by delineation and, in some cases, production history to determine 1P and 2P reserve additions. Importantly, these results were achieved with financial discipline, spending $126 million which was substantially less than forecast. The most significant drilling result for the year was the Jeruk oil discovery in the Sampang PSC offshore East Java, Indonesia. The Jeruk discovery is still under evaluation but its commercial significance appears encouraging. Santos has confirmed an oil column of at least 379 metres with a likely gross recoverable resource in excess of the pre-drill estimate of 170 million barrels. Santos also had further exploration successes in the Cooper Basin in central Australia where four of six wildcat wells were cased and suspended as gas discoveries. There was also success in the offshore Otway Basin with the Martha gas discovery near the Casino field, which is currently being evaluated to determine its commercial significance. Additional drilling is planned to occur nearby in 2005 to follow up this encouraging result. Santos discovered gas in the United States at the Torres 1A onshore well, which was brought onto production only two months after drilling was completed. Other wells in the offshore Otway Basin included the deep water Amrit 1 well, which was plugged and abandoned after failing to intersect economic hydrocarbons, and Callister 1 which was also plugged and abandoned with gas shows.",

As a result of this activity, Santos realised an after-tax profit of $47.4 million on oil and gas asset sales and will continue to high-grade its portfolio on an ongoing basis. Santos entered into an agreement with PT Medco during the first half of 2004 to acquire some of Novus Petroleum\u2019s Indonesian and Cooper Basin assets conditional on the success of PT Medco\u2019s takeover offer for Novus, which was ultimately successful. Specifically, Santos announced in September 2004 that it had executed formal agreements to acquire an additional 4.75% of the South Australian Cooper Basin, 18% of the Brantas PSC and 9% of the Kakap PSC from Medco for US$110 million. On 31 December 2004, Santos paid Medco US$98 million for the majority of the assets, with payment for the remaining 2.75% of Kakap PSC expected to be made in the first quarter of 2005. This acquisition was an important piece in the strategic puzzle to tie up access to follow-up potential from the successful exploration at Jeruk and to provide a production base for the newly established Indonesian core area. Also during the first half of 2004, Santos divested its remaining 18.4% shareholding in Magellan Petroleum Australia Ltd, raising approximately $10.6 million. Early in the second half of 2004, Santos concluded the sale of its non-core onshore Otway Basin interests to Origin Energy for $25.75 million. This sale resulted in an after-tax profit of $18 million that was booked in 2004."

In addition, we provide individually tailored guidance to help Group companies identify categories of risk that need to be addressed. Risk catego- ries are constantly reviewed, and new categories may be added in response to changes in the operating environment. The Corporate Risk Management Department works with the Corporate Planning Department to comprehensively and systematically manage all these categories of risk across the entire Group. (2) Fundamental Principles and Basic Policies for Risk Management SMFG\u2019s Groupwide basic policies for risk management stipulate the fundamental principles for risk management that must be followed, and spell out risk management procedures from various perspec- tives. These include managing risk on a consolidated accounting basis, managing risk using quantification methods, ensuring con- sistency with business strategies, setting up a system of checks and balances, contingency planning for emergencies and serious situations, and verifying preparedness to handle all conceivable risk situations. In addition, there are specific operational policies for implementing appropriate management of risk by all Group companies."

Many ad- ditional advantages and uses of the systems and meth- ods will become apparent from the following detailed de- scription, which proceeds with reference to the accom- panying drawings.",
      "reading_order_3": "[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic cross-section view of a system 10 according to a first embodiment for the deposition of a thin-film coating onto a flexible sub- strate 12 (shown in profile in FIG. 1), such as a web of plastic film or metal foil, for example. With reference to FIG. 1, system 10 includes first and second precursor zones 14 and 16, respectively, separated by an interme- diate isolation zone 20 in which an inert fluid is present. The inert fluid may comprise an inert liquid, but more preferably consists essentially of an inert gas, such as nitrogen (N2). When in use, reactive first and second pre- cursor gases (Precursor 1 and Precursor 2) are intro- duced into the respective first and second precursor zones 14,16 from first and second precursor delivery sys- tems 24, 26. Precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clude precursor source containers (not shown) located outside or within precursor zones 14, 16. Additionally or alternatively, precursor delivery systems 24, 26 may in- clude piping, pumps, valves, tanks, and other associated equipment for supplying precursor gases into precursor zones 14, 16. An inert gas delivery system 28 is similarly included for injecting inert gas into isolation zone 20.",
      "reading_order_4": "[0021] In the embodiment shown, precursor zones 14,16 and isolation zone 20 are defined and bordered by an outer reaction chamber housing or vessel 30, divided by first and second dividers 34, 36 into three sub-cham- bers, namely, a first precursor chamber 44, a second precursor chamber 46 and an inert gas chamber 50. Ves- sel 30 may comprise a pressure vessel or vacuum vessel substantially isolating the process space from the exter- nal environment. In other embodiments, the vessel 30 may have entrance and exit passageways for interfacing with other process modules or equipment, as described below with reference to FIG. 4. A series of first passage- ways 54 through first divider 34 are spaced apart along a general direction of travel of substrate 12, and a cor- responding series of second passageways 56 are pro- vided through second divider 36. The passageways 54, 56 are arranged and configured for substrate 12 to be threaded therethrough back and forth between first and second precursor zones 14,16 multiple times, and each time through isolation zone 20. For a web substrate, pas- sageways 54, 56 preferably comprise slits having a width (exaggerated in FIG. 1) that is slightly greater than the thickness of substrate 12 and a length (not shown) ex- tending into the plane of FIG.1 (i.e., normal to the page) and that is slightly greater than a width of the substrate. Isolation zone 20 is, thus, preferably separated (albeit imperfectly) from the first precursor zone 14 by first di- vider 34 and from second precursor zone 16 by second divider 36.",
      "reading_order_5": "[0022] To substantially prevent non-ALD reactions caused by mixing of nonadsorbed quantities of the first and second precursor gases in one of the chambers 44, 46, 50, it is necessary for the system 10 to inhibit the migration of Precursor 1 from first precursor zone 14 into isolation zone 20 and the migration of Precursor 2 from second precursor zone 16 into isolation zone 20. Pas- sageways 54, 56 are preferably configured to restrict the flow of gases between the zones 14,16, 20, to avoid or limit diffusion of precursor gases into a common zone. Passageways 54, 56 may include slits sized only slightly thicker and wider than the thickness and width of the substrate passing through them, leaving only a very small amount of headroom and margins to allow substrate 12 to pass therethrough without scraping against the sides of the passageways. For example, headroom and mar- gins may range between microns and millimeters in cer- tain embodiments. The passageways 54, 56 may also include elongate tunnels through which the substrate 12 passes, as depicted in FIGS. 1, 2, and 4. Such slits and tunnels are sometimes referred to as slit valves, although no actual moving valve gate is utilized. In some embod- iments, the passageways 54, 56 include a wiper for fur- ther restricting flow. In one such embodiment, the sub- strate is threaded through opposing leaves of resilient material, such as a synthetic rubber, which wipe against opposing surfaces of the substrate.",
      "reading_order_6": "[0023] In an alternate embodiment (not shown), the inert gas chamber 50 of isolation zone 20 and dividers 34, 36 are eliminated, so that isolation zone 20 essentially consists of a series of long narrow passageways extend- ing completely between precursor zones 14,16. In such an embodiment, no common inert gas chamber 50 con- nects the passageways, so inert gas is injected directly into the passageways medially of the first and second precursor zones 14,16 to help prevent precursor migra- tion and mixing. Isolation zone 20 of this embodiment would include a manifold, or a number of manifolds, for routing inert gas lines to nozzles along the sides of the passageways. The manifold or manifolds would be formed in the material of the reaction chamber bordering the passageways, and may be connected to an inert gas delivery system along the sides of the system, rather than at an end of the system as shown in FIG. 1.",
      "reading_order_7": "[0024] To help isolate the first precursor gas from the second precursor gas, pressure differentials are prefer- ably established between the isolation zone 20 and the first precursor zone 14 and between the isolation zone 20 and the second precursor zone 16. In one embodi- ment, the pressure differentials may be generated by in- jecting inert gas into isolation zone 20 at a pressure great- er than the operating pressure of the precursor zones 14, 16, and then passively exhausting gases from the precursor zones 14, 16. In another embodiment, the ex- haust from precursor zones 14, 16 could be controlled relative to a passive exhaust from isolation zone 20 or by throttling an exhaust flow from isolation zone 20. Pres- sure differentials may also be generated by pumping from"

      "reading_order_2": "At December 31, 2004, there is a $6 million valuation allowance provided on certain New Jersey state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey state deferred tax assets because management believes these assets do not meet the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d criteria for recognition under SFAS 109. Management believes all other deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. Accordingly, there are no other valuation allowances provided at December 31, 2004. The Company is evaluating the impact of provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the \u201cAct\u201d) that provide for a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional guidance from Congress and/or the United States Treasury Department will be necessary for the Company to complete its evaluation, as it is not clear at this time whether the Act will provide a benefit to the Company. The Company will complete the evaluation as promptly as practicable following the issuance of such guidance and adjust taxes accordingly, if necessary. The Company has not yet repatriated the net proceeds from the sale of MGM Grand Australia pending the evaluation. Nonetheless, the Company provided in 2004 deferred U.S. income taxes of $11 million on the basis that such proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of the 85 percent one-time deduction. Such amount was included in the provision for income taxes on discontinued operations for 2004. The Company considered the earnings of its Australia operations permanently reinvested prior to the sale of such operations. If guidance is issued that indicates the planned repatriation qualifies for the one-time deduction, the Company will recognize a tax benefit of approximately $7 million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which such guidance is issued. If no such guidance is issued within the applicable timeframe, then the Company will attempt to permanently reinvest the proceeds in another foreign jurisdiction, such as Macau. In such case, the Company would recognize a tax benefit of $11 million as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which the reinvestment is made. The Company currently does not have a plan to reinvest the proceeds in such manner.",

The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide for escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals. At December 31, 2004, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operat- ing leases and capital leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:"
