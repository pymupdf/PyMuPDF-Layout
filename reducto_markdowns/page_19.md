The graph shows a coordinate system with Y₁ on the vertical axis and Y₀ on the horizontal axis, featuring a yellow triangular region in the upper right quadrant that represents the support under concave treatment response. Two diagonal lines intersect at the origin where Y₁ = Y₀, with mathematical expressions shown for specific points involving treatment parameters t₁, t₀, tᵧᵧ, and w. The yellow shaded area indicates the feasible region for outcomes under the concave treatment response assumption.

The function \( \varphi \) can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum \( B_{k}=(-\infty, b_{k}) \) with \( b_{k+1} \leq b_{k} \) and \( b_{k} \in[-\infty, \infty] \) for every integer \( k \). By Theorem 1, for \( \delta>0, B_{k}^{D} \) is written as

\( B_{k}^{D}= \) \( \left\{\begin{array}{l}y_{1} \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists y_{0}<b_{k} \mathrm{~s.t.} . 0 \leq y_{1}-y_{0}<\delta \mathrm{~and} \left(t_{0}-t_{W}\right) y_{1}-\left(t_{1}-t_{W}\right) y_{0} \leq-\left(t_{1}-t_{0}\right) w\right. \\ \left.\bigcup \left\{y_{1} \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists y_{0}<b_{k+1} \mathrm{~s.t.} . y_{1}-y_{0} \geq \delta \mathrm{~and} \left(t_{0}-t_{W}\right) y_{1}-\left(t_{1}-t_{W}\right) y_{0} \leq-\left(t_{1}-t_{0}\right) w\right\}\right. \) .

Note that \( Y_{1}=Y_{0}+\delta \) and \( Y_{1}=\frac{t_{1}-t_{W}}{t_{0}-t_{W}} Y_{0}-\frac{t_{1}-t_{0}}{t_{0}-t_{W}} w \) intersect at \( \left(\frac{t_{0}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+y-1, \frac{t_{1}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w\right) \). I consider the following three cases: a) \( b_{k+1} \leq b_{k} \leq \frac{t_{0}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \), b) \( b_{k+1} \leq \frac{t_{0}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \leq b_{k} \), and c) \( \frac{t_{0}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \leq \) \( b_{k+1} \leq b_{k} \).

The image shows three graphs (a), (b), and (c) illustrating different configurations of economic variables Y₁ and Y₀ with intersecting lines and shaded regions. Each graph depicts the relationship between these variables under different boundary conditions involving parameters bₖ and bₖ₊₁. The graphs use purple/violet shading to highlight specific regions and include dotted and dashed lines to show constraints and intersections.

Case a) \( b_{k+1} \leq b_{k} \leq \frac{t_{0}-t_{W}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \)

If \( b_{k+1} \leq b_{k} \leq \frac{t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{W}}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \), as illustrated in Figure A.5(a), for any \( y_{0}<b_{k+1} \leq \frac{t_{0}-t_{\mathrm{W}}}{t_{1}-t_{0}} \delta+w \), there exists
