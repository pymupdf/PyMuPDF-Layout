[0291] Among those, the photoacid generator is preferably a photoacid generator including an anionic moiety and a cationic moiety from the viewpoint that the effect of the present invention is more excellent.

[0292] More specifically, the photoacid generator is preferably a compound represented by General Formula (ZI) or General Formula (ZII).

(ZI)
\( \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{R}_{202} \mathrm{~Z}^{-} \\ \mid \\ \mathrm{R}_{201}-\mathrm{S}^{+}-\mathrm{R}_{203}\end{array} \)

(ZII)
\( \begin{array}{l}\mathrm{R}_{204}-\mathrm{I}^{+}-\mathrm{R}_{205} \\ \mathrm{Z}^{-}\end{array} \)

[0293] In General Formula (ZI),

[0294] R201, R202, and R203 each independently represent an organic group.

[0295] The number of carbon atoms of the organic group as each of R_{201}, R_{202}, and R_{203} is preferably 1 to 30, and more preferably 1 to 20.

[0296] Furthermore, two of R201 to R203 may be bonded to each other to form a ring structure, and the ring may include an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, an ester bond, an amide bond, or a carbonyl group, and examples of the group formed by the bonding of two of R201 to R203 include an alkylene group (for example, a butylene group and a pentylene group).

[0297] Z⁻ represents a non-nucleophilic anion (anion having a remarkably low ability of causing a nucleophilic reaction).

a

[0298] Examples of the non-nucleophilic anion include a sulfonate anion (such as an aliphatic sulfonate anion, an aromatic sulfonate anion, and a camphor sulfonate anion), a carboxylate anion (such as an aliphatic carboxylate anion, an aromatic carboxylate anion, and an aralkyl carboxylate anion), a sulfonylimide anion, a bis(alkylsulfonyl)imide anion, and a tris(alkylsulfonyl)methide anion.

[0299] The aliphatic moiety in the aliphatic sulfonate anion and the aliphatic carboxylate anion may be an alkyl group or a cycloalkyl group, and is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 30 carbon atoms.

[0300] As the aromatic ring group in the aromatic sul-
fonate anion and the aromatic carboxylate anion, an aryl
group having 6 to 14 carbon atoms is preferable, and
examples thereof include a phenyl group, a tolyl group, and
a naphthyl group.

[0301] Specific examples of the substituent which may be contained in the alkyl group, the cycloalkyl group, and the aryl group exemplified above include a nitro group, a halogen atom such as fluorine atom, a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a cyano group, an alkoxy group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), a cycloalkyl group (preferably having 3 to 15 carbon atoms), an aryl group (preferably having 6 to 14 carbon atoms), an alkoxy carbonyl group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an acyl group (preferably having 2 to 12 carbon atoms), an alkoxy carbonyloxy group (preferably having 2 to 7 carbon atoms), an alkylthio group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an alkylsulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an alkyliminosulfonyl group (preferably having 1 to 15 carbon atoms), an aryloxysulfonyl group (preferably having 6 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyl aryloxy sulfonyl group (preferably having 7 to 20 carbon atoms), a cycloalkylaryloxy sulfonyl group (preferably having 10 to 20 carbon atoms), an alkyl oxy alkyl oxy group (preferably having 5 to 20 carbon atoms), and a cycloalkyl alkyl oxy alkyl oxy group (preferably having 8 to 20 carbon atoms).
