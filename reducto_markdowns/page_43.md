# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is

avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the

same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation

(TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no

misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be

indicated only once within the identification box. Very High

Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names

and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only

| Feature | Information |
| :--- | :--- |
| **NAVAID Details** | |
| Type | VORTAC |
| Name | PONTIAC |
| FSS Radio Frequencies | 122.1R, 123.6 |
| NDB Frequency | 379 |
| Channel | Ch 47 |
| Identifier | PTK |
| Morse Code | .--. - -.- |
| Weather | ASOS/AWOS |
| Operational Note | FSS oper 0600-2200. Rancho Murleta FSS other times. |
| **Legend / Symbology** | **Meaning** |
| Crosshatch | Indicates Shutdown status |
| Asterisk (`*`) | Operates less than continuous or on-request |
| Circled A (`A`) | Indicates ASOS/AWOS is available |

those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of

separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio

aids.

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or "DME" (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

This image shows a VOR-DME navigational aid diagram with a compass rose displaying directional markings from 0 to 360 degrees. The NAVAID is identified as "VOR SALEM 114.3 SVM" in a box at the top, with an airplane symbol and directional indicator below it. The diagram includes explanatory text noting that an open circle symbol indicates when the NAVAID has weather broadcast capability, and that the type designation appears at the top of the information box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

## AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section).
Public use airports:



4 Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069' or some multiple runways less than 8069'



- Hard-surfaced runways 1500' to 8069'



	- Other than hard-surfaced runways

⚓ Seaplane bases

Military airports:

O



Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation DND (Department of National Defense).

Fuel Available:



Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.

Other airports with or without fuel:
