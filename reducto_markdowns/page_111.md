The image shows a chemical structure diagram labeled as Formula (A-1) featuring a polymer backbone with pendant groups. The structure contains an ester linkage connecting to a cyclic acetal or ketal moiety through a divalent linking group A. Various substituents are indicated including R^A (hydrogen or alkyl), R^2 substituents, and Z representing an atomic group that forms the cyclic structure.

In Formula (A-1), \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{1} \) represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group.
If n is 2 or more, \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{2} \) 's each independently represents a substituent.
A represents a single bond or a divalent linking group.
Z represents a atomic group forming a monocyclid or polycyclic structure together with a group represented by \( \mathrm{~O}-\mathrm{C}(=\mathrm{O})-\mathrm{O}- \) in the formula.
n represents an integer of 0 or more.
Formula (A-1) will be described in detail.
The alkyl group represented by \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{1} \) may have a substituent such as a fluorine atom. \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{1} \) represents preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluormethyl group, and more preferably a methyl group.
The substituent represented by \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{2} \) is, for example, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxy carbonylamino group. The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, a straight alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group and a butyl group; and a branched alkyl group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. An alkyl group may have a substituent such as a hydroxyl group.
n represents the number of substituents, and is an integer of 0 or more. For example, n is preferably 0 to 4, and more preferably 0.
Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by A may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond,

an urea bond, or combination thereof. Examples of the alkylene group may include preferably an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably an alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and for example a methylene group, an ethylene group, an propylene group, and the like.

In one aspect of the present invention, A is preferably a single bond, or an alkylene group.

The monocyclic group containing -O-C(=O)-O-, represented by Z is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which \( n_{A}=2 \) to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a), and preferably a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring \( \left(\mathrm{n}_{A}=2 \) or 3), and more preferably a 5-membered ring \( \left(\mathrm{n}_{A}=2\right) \).

The polycyclic group containing -O-C(=O)-O- represented by Z may, for example, be a structure in which a cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclid hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic ring.

The monomer corresponding to the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be synthesized by a conventionally known method described in, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 32 p. 3741(1986), Organic Letters, Vol. 4, No. 15 p. 2561(2002), and the like.

In the resin (A), the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be contained either alone or in a combination of two or more thereof.

Hereinafter, specific examples of the repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto.

In addition, \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{1} \) in the following specific examples has the same meaning as \( \mathrm{R}_{A}^{1} \) in Formula (A-1).

The image shows two similar chemical structures, each containing a cyclic backbone with R₄¹ substituents and ester linkages. Both structures feature a five-membered ring with oxygen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O) in the lower portion. The main difference between the two structures appears to be in the positioning or connectivity of the linking chains between the upper and lower ring systems.
