Panel A shows probability density distributions for Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity at four different static connectivity levels (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0), demonstrating that the variances are similar across all levels despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes. Panel B displays a scatter plot of standard deviation versus mean for Fisher-transformed functional connectivity, revealing no systematic relationship between temporal mean and variability. This contrasts with non-transformed data where static connectivity magnitude strongly influences the range of dynamic fluctuations and creates systematic relationships between mean and variance.

Figure S1: We show the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on the range of dynamic fluctuations in Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Given four levels of static functional connectivity, we show the expected range of distribution Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connections. Note that despite the wide range of static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of distributions are similar. Contrast this with Figure 2 in the main text, where static connectivity magnitude played a massive role in shaping the range of dynamic fluctuations. (B) The relationship of the temporal mean and standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix. Note that there is no systematic relationship. Contrast this panel with panel C in Figure 1 from the main text.

Panel A shows that Fisher transformation preserves the rank order of correlation coefficients, with Fisher percentiles correlating nearly perfectly (r≈1) with Pearson percentiles. Panel B demonstrates a strong correlation (r=0.97) between static functional connectivity and mean dynamic functional connectivity when both are Fisher-transformed. The Fisher transformation maintains the relationships between static and dynamic connectivity measures while normalizing their distributions.

Figure S2: Comparison of raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients. (A) Because the Fisher transformation is monotonic (preserves rank) it does not change percentiles in any appreciable way. The correlation of the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix with the percentile matrix obtained from raw Pearson correlation coefficients is \( r \approx 1 \). (B) We also calculated the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity.
