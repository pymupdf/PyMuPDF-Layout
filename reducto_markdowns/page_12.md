The figure demonstrates partition degeneracy in dynamic functional connectivity analysis, showing 100 different network partitions obtained from modularity maximization on a single dataset. Panel B reveals an association matrix indicating how frequently node pairs were grouped together across partitions, while panel C shows z-score Rand indices measuring partition similarity. Most participants (76 out of 80) showed positive correlations between partition degeneracy (measured by z-score Rand index) and excursion count, suggesting that network instability increases with dynamic activity.

Figure 5: Partition degeneracy and correlation with excursion count. (A) As an example, we show the set of 100 partitions obtained by maximizing modularity for a single instance of dFC (169 events). (B) The association matrix for this set of partitions. Each element in the association matrix counts the number of times that two nodes were assigned to the same partition. The node order is the same as in Figure 4. (C) Matrix of z-score Rand indices for all pairs of the 100 partitions shown in panel (A). (D) We show the scatterplot of mean z-score Rand index for each time point plotted against the event count, both calculated at the same time point, for one representative participant. (E) Correlation coefficients for z-score Rand index and event count plotted across participants. Note that of the 80 participants, only four exhibited negative correlations.

### Plot C: Number of Significant Co-assignment Changes

The table below contains the approximate data from the bar chart in Figure C, which shows the number of significant co-assignment changes for different brain network nodes, ordered by rank (from highest to lowest number of changes).

Figure 6: Default mode network dissociates during mass-excursions. A) Mean difference in association matrices constructed during non-mass excursions and excursions. B) Node pairs that were statistically more or less likely to be observed in the same community during nonexcursions compared to excursions. The network labels are taken from Yeo et al. (2011), with labels corresponding to networks for control (CONT), default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN), limbic (LIM), ventral attention (VAN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual (VIS). C) We sum the rows of the matrix in panel B) to identify regions that that consistently change their community co-assignments with other regions. The regions that change the most are predominantly regions associated with DMN.
