2. The import mappings window opens. Select the source host from which you want to import the volume mappings. As shown in Figure 8-39, we select the host ITS0-VMHOST-01 and click Import.

The image shows an "Import Mappings" dialog window with a dropdown menu for selecting a source host. The dropdown currently displays "ITSO-VMHOST-" as the selected host option. At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons: "Cancel" and "Import" for completing or canceling the import operation.

3. After the task completes, verify that the mappings are as expected from the Hosts menu (see Figure 8-26 on page 346), right-click the target host, and select Properties. Then, click the Mapped Volumes tab and verify that the required volumes were mapped to the new host (see Figure 8-37 on page 353).

## Renaming a host

To rename a host, complete the following steps:

1. Select the host, and then right-click and select Rename (see Figure 8-40).

The image shows a host management interface with an "Actions" dropdown menu opened, displaying various host configuration options including "Rename" which is highlighted. The interface displays a table with columns for Name, Host Type, # of Ports, Host Mappings, Host Cluster ID, and Host Cluster Name, showing two generic hosts with 2 ports each. The context menu provides options for host cluster management, volume mappings, throttling, and other administrative functions.
