The image shows chemical structures of polymer repeat units with aromatic benzene rings connected to polymer backbones. The top four structures contain ester linkages and hydroxyl groups with various alkyl substituents, while the bottom four structures show ether linkages connecting the aromatic rings to bulky cyclic groups like adamantane and cyclohexane. All structures appear to be monomeric units that would be incorporated into larger polymer chains, as indicated by the polymer backbone notation.

The image shows two similar chemical structures, both containing benzene rings attached to cyclohexane rings with hydroxyl (OH) groups. The left structure has a methoxy group (MeO) attached to the cyclohexane ring, while the right structure has an additional hydroxyl group instead. Both structures appear to be polymer repeating units as indicated by the polymer notation marks.

[0144] As the amount of the repeating unit BN2, the lower limit is preferably 5 mol %, more preferably 10 mol % based on the whole repeating units constituting the component (B). The upper limit is preferably 70 mol %, more preferably 60 mol %.

[0145] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) preferably contains the repeating unit BN2, additionally at least one kind of a repeating unit selected from the repeating units B3 to B5 in addition to the repeating unit B1 in view of coexisting high etching durability and resolution. In this case, these repeating units are contained in an amount of 60 mol % or more, more preferably 70 mol % or more, and still more preferably 80 mol % or more in the whole repeating units. This securely gives properties demanded for the inventive negative resist composition.

[0146] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) may contain a lactone structure, a (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group such as a hydroxy group other than the phenolic hydroxy group, and other repeating units in order to fine-tune the properties of a resist film. Illustrative examples of the (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group include the units shown by the following general formulae (b1) to (b3). These units can be used supplementary as a unit to control the unit to give adhesiveness to a substrate and the solubility without showing acidity.

This image shows chemical structures of various organic compounds, primarily featuring benzene rings connected to bulky substituents and ether linkages. The structures include tert-butyl groups, cyclohexyl rings, and adamantyl-type cage structures as protecting groups or substituents. The compounds appear to be examples of sterically hindered molecules, likely used as synthetic intermediates or protective reagents in organic chemistry.
