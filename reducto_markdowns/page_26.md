## Remote Communications Outlet (RCO)

Thin line NAVAID boxes without frequencies and controlling FSS name indicate no FSS frequencies available. Frequencies positioned above the thin line boxes are remoted to the NAVAID sites. Other frequencies at the controlling FSS named are available, however altitude and terrain may determine their reception.

In Canada, a "D" after the frequency indicates a dial-up remote communications outlet.
