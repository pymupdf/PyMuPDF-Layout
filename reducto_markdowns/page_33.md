# Runway Declared Distance Information

Runway declared distance information when available will be indicated by D and is shown to the right of the airport

elevation in the sketch box. Declared distances for a runway represent the maximum distances available and suitable for

meeting takeoff and landing distance performance requirements.



## Runway Lights

Notes regarding approach lighting systems are shown at the bottom of the sketch box. Runway lights (Hirl) (Mirl) (Lirl) (TDZL)(TDZ/CL) shall be indicated by a note, e.g. Hirl Rwy 9-27.

Other approach lighting is shown on the airport sketch as a symbol on the side of the runway where they are actually located. Symbols that are shown in negative indicate pilot-controlled lighting.

| Knots | Min:Sec |
|-------|---------|
| 60    | 5:00    |
| 90    | 3:20    |
| 120   | 2:30    |
| 150   | 2:00    |
| 180   | 1:40    |

Runway centerline lights (CL) are installed on some precision approach runways to facilitate landing under adverse visibility conditions. They are located along the runway centerline and are spaced at 50 foot intervals. Runways with CL are shown in a negative dot pattern through the middle of the solid runway as illustrated in the airport sketch to right.

Runway centerline lights will be indicated by a note only when paired with TDZL, e.g., TDZ/CL
Rwys 6 and 24.

## Time/Distance Table

When applicable, a Time/Distance Table is provided below the airport sketch. The table provides the distance and time that is required from the final approach fix to the missed approach point for select groundspeeds.

## Base Information (Copter Approaches Only)

Base Information, as required and necessary to identify the MAP area and in the vicinity of the landing area shall be provided. Information shall be limited to and depict significant visual landmark features at and surrounding the MAP area and the heliport/pad of intended landing.

## AIRPORT DIAGRAMS

Airport Diagrams are specifically designed to assist in the movement of ground traffic at locations with complex runway/ taxiway configurations. Airport Diagrams are not intended for use in approach and landing or departure operations. An airport diagram assists pilots in identifying their location on the airport, thus reducing requests for "progressive taxi instructions" from controllers.
