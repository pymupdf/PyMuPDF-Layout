Now choose any cell in this table and choose Pivot Table wizard in the Data menu. Excel asks for the data source and suggests this table. Click OK.

| Name of Worker | Week | Nature of Payment | Amount |
|----------------|------|---------------------|--------|
| X              | 1    | Washing Allowance   | 25     |
| X              | 1    | Conveyance Expenses | 30     |

Dare
to understand

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than A1:D50, you may want to specify $A$1:$D$500.

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.

The image shows a "Create PivotTable" dialog box in Excel with options for selecting data to analyze and choosing the destination for the pivot table report. The data source is set to "Select a table or range" with a table range of "Sheet1!$A$2:$D$9". The destination section is highlighted in red, showing options to place the PivotTable in either a "New Worksheet" or "Existing Worksheet" with a location field.
