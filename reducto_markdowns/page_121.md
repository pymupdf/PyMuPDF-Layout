This image shows chemical structures of polymer compounds labeled as "P-54" with various organic components including benzene rings, methoxy groups, and sulfonate groups. The structures appear to be continuation segments of larger polymer chains, as indicated by the "-continued" labels and polymer backbone connections. The compounds feature complex aromatic systems with substituents like fluorine atoms, methyl groups, and ester linkages connecting different molecular segments.

The image shows chemical structures of polymer components labeled P-54 and P-55, featuring various organic compounds with aromatic rings and functional groups. P-54 contains polymer chains with phenyl groups connected to sulfonyl fluoride moieties and triarylsulfonium salts with methoxy substituents, along with an anthracene-based ester compound. P-55 includes polymer backbones with biphenyl and naphthyl units containing hydroxyl groups, triphenylsulfonium salt, and a methoxynaphthalene ester derivative.

[0317] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are described below.

## (Photo-Acid Generator)

[0318] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae (ZI), (ZII) and (ZIII):
