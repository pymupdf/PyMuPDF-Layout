## 2.5. Tender submission: how many tenders may an economic operator submit?

Economic operators may submit one tender. In case an economic operator submits more than one tender (as sole tenderer and/or as a joint tenderer in a group of tenderers) without withdrawing any of them, as foreseen in the Invitation to Tender, only the latest tender submitted before the time limit for receipt of tenders will be considered. In case of omissions in the latest submission, tenderers will not be able to refer to earlier submissions and may be rejected if mandatory information is missing.
