![Figure 12: New bounds v.s. Makarov bounds](figure-12.png)

**Figure 12 (summary):** This figure presents a 3x3 grid of plots, illustrating various bounds for the Distribution of Treatment Effects (DTE) against an x-axis likely representing a parameter or outcome range, and a y-axis representing cumulative probability (from 0 to 1). Each subplot corresponds to different combinations of parameters `k1` (rows: 1, 5, 10) and `k2` (columns: 1, 10, 40). Within each plot, four curves are compared: 'True DTE' (solid black), 'Makarov lower' (dashed red), 'Makarov upper' (solid black), and 'New lower bound' (solid blue). The plots demonstrate how the 'New lower bound' compares to the 'True DTE' and the 'Makarov bounds' under varying conditions, generally showing the relationship and tightness of these bounds.

$F_0$ and $F_1$ over the support causes more triangles having positive probability lower bounds, which leads the improvement of my new lower bound. On the other hand, the Makarov lower bound gets no such informational gain because it uses only one triangle while my new lower bound takes advantage of *multiple* triangles.

## 5 Application to the Distribution of Effects of Smoking on Birth Weight

In this section, I apply the results presented in Section 3 to an empirical analysis of the distribution of smoking effects on infant birth weight. Smoking not only has a direct impact on infant birth weight, but is also associated with unobservable factors that affect infant birth weight. I identify marginal distributions of potential infant birth weight with and without smoking by making use of a state cigarette tax hike in Massachusetts (MA) in January 1993 as a source of exogenous variation. I focus on pregnant women who change their smoking behavior from smoking to nonsmoking in response to the tax increase. To identify the distribution of smoking effects, I impose a MTR restriction that smoking has nonpositive effects on infant birth weight with probability one. I propose an estimation procedure and report estimates of the DTE
