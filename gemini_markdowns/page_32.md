## APPLICATION OF AERODYNAMICS TO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF FLYING

invitation for trouble of many sorts. The normal and emergency procedures applicable to each specific airplane will insure the proper operation of the equipment.

1.  ***Operating Limitations***. The operation of the airplane and powerplant must be conducted within the established limitations. Failure to do so will invite failure or malfunction of the equipment and increase the operating cost or possibly cause an accident.
2.  ***Flight Characteristics***. While all aircraft will have certain minimum requirements for flying qualities, the actual peculiarities and special features of specific airplanes will differ. These particular flight characteristics must be well known and understood by the pilot.
3.  ***Operating Data***. The performance of each specific airplane defines its application to various uses and missions. The handbook operating data must be available at all times to properly plan and execute the flight of an aircraft. Constant reference to the operating data will insure safe and effective operation of the airplane.

Great time and effort are expended in the preparation of the flight handbook to provide the most exact information, data, and procedures. Diligent study and continuous use of the flight handbook will ensure that the greatest effectiveness is achieved from the airplane while still operating within the inherent capabilities of the design.
