## Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) Areas Relating to National Security
A Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) is a type of Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). A TFR defines an area where air travel is restricted due to a hazardous condition, a special event, or a general warning for the entire airspace. The text of the actual TFR contains the fine points of the restriction. It is important to note that only TFRs relating to National Security are charted.

## Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZs)
Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZs) are symbolized using the ADIZ symbol (a pattern of purple dots). As defined in Code of Federal Regulations 14 (CFR 14) Part 99, an ADIZ is an area in which the ready identification, location, and control of all aircraft is required in the interest of national security. ADIZ boundaries include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Canada and the Contiguous U.S.

## Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSAs)
Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSAs) are shown in their entirety, symbolized by a screened black outline of the entire area including the various sectors within the area (indicated by a grey rectangular block in the original document).

The outer limit of the entire Terminal Radar Service Areas (TRSA) is a continuous screened black line. The various sectors within the TRSA are symbolized by narrower screened black lines.

Each sector altitude is identified in solid black color by the MSL ceiling and floor values of the respective sector, eliminating the last two zeros. A leader line is used when the altitude values must be positioned outside the respective sectors because of charting space limitations. The TRSA name is shown near the north position of the TRSA as follows: **PALM SPRINGS TRSA**. Associated frequencies are listed in a table on the chart border.

## Military Training Routes (MTRs)
Military Training Routes (MTRs) are shown on Sectionals and TACs. They are identified by the route designator: IR21. Route designators are shown in solid black on the route centerline, positioned along the route for continuity. The designator IR or VR is not repeated when two or more routes are established over the same airspace, e.g., IR201-205-227. Routes numbered 001 to 099 are shown as IR1 or VR99, eliminating the initial zeros. Direction of flight along the route is indicated by small arrowheads adjacent to and in conjunction with each route designator.

The following note appears on Helicopters, Sectionals and TACs except for Hawaiian Islands which is different.

> **MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES (MTRS)**
> All IR and VR MTRs are shown, and may extend from the surface upwards. Only the route centerline, direction of flight along the route, and the route designator are depicted - route widths and altitudes are not shown. DoD users refer to Area Planning AP/1B Military Training Routes North and South America for current routes.

There are IFR (IR) and VFR (VR) routes as follows:

Route identification:
1.  Routes at or below 1500' AGL (with no segment above 1500') are identified by four-digit numbers; e.g., VR1007, etc. These routes are generally developed for flight under Visual Flight Rules.
2.  Routes above 1500' AGL (some segments of these routes may be below 1500') are identified by three or fewer digit numbers; e.g., IR21, VR302, etc. These routes are developed for flight under Instrument Flight Rules.

MTRs can vary in width from 4 to 16 miles. Detailed route width information is available in the Flight Information Publication (FLIP) AP/1B (a Department of Defense publication), or through the 56 Day NASR Subscription from the National Flight Data Center (NFDC).

## Special Military Activity Areas
Special Military Activity areas are indicated on Sectionals by a boxed note in black type. The note contains radio frequency information for obtaining area activity status.

> **SPECIAL MILITARY ACTIVITY**
> **CTC MOBILE RADIO**
> **ON 123,6**
> **FOR ACTIVITY STATUS**
