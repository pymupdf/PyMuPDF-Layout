In one aspect of the present invention, A is preferably a single bond, or an alkylene group.

The monocyclic group containing $\ce{O-C(=O)-O}$, represented by Z, is, for example, a 5- to 7-membered ring in which $n_A=2$ to 4 in the cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a), and preferably a 5-membered ring or a 6-membered ring ($n_A=2$ or 3), and more preferably a 5-membered ring ($n_A=2$).

The polycyclic group containing $\ce{O-C(=O)-O}$ represented by Z may, for example, be a structure in which a cyclic carbonate ester represented by the following Formula (a) are bound with 1 or 2 or more other ring structure to form a condensed ring or to form a spiro ring. "Other ring structures" capable of forming a condensed ring or spiro ring may be an alicyclic hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydrocarbon group or a heterocyclic ring.

**Specific example of Formula (A-1) (summary):** This structure shows a polymer repeating unit. An $\ce{R_x}$ group (likely $\ce{R_A^1}$ as per the text) indicates the connection to the polymer backbone. A pendant group, attached via an ester linkage, consists of a cyclohexyl ring which is substituted with two trifluoromethyl ($\ce{-CF3}$) groups and two hydroxyl ($\ce{-OH}$) groups, and also forms part of a cyclic carbonate ester structure.

The polar group which may be possessed by the repeating unit having a polar group may be a carbonate group such as a cyclic carbonate ester structure, and the resin (A) preferably contain a repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure.

The repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure is preferably the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1).

**Formula (A-1) (summary):** This represents a generic polymer repeating unit. $\ce{R_A^1}$ is attached to the polymer main chain. A side chain is linked via an ester ($\ce{-C(=O)O-}$) to a divalent linking group $\ce{A}$. $\ce{A}$ is connected to an atomic group $\ce{Z}$, which forms a monocyclic or polycyclic structure with a $\ce{O-C(=O)-O}$ group. $\ce{Z}$ is further substituted by $\ce{(R_A^2)_n}$.

**Formula (a) (summary):** This depicts a generic cyclic carbonate ring structure. The symbol $n_A$ is associated with the ring, indicating its size or substitution pattern. As per the text, this can be a 5- to 7-membered ring.

The monomer corresponding to the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be synthesized by a conventionally known method described in, for example, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 27, No. 32 p. 3741(1986), Organic Letters, Vol. 4, No. 15 p. 2561(2002), and the like.

In Formula (A-1), $\ce{R_A^1}$ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group.

If n is 2 or more, $\ce{R_A^2}$'s each independently represents a substituent.

A represents a single bond or a divalent linking group.

Z represents an atomic group forming a monocyclic or polycyclic structure together with a group represented by $\ce{O-C(=O)-O}$ in the formula.

n represents an integer of 0 or more.

Formula (A-1) will be described in detail.

The alkyl group represented by $\ce{R_A^1}$ may have a substituent such as a fluorine atom. $\ce{R_A^1}$ represents preferably a hydrogen atom, a methyl group or a trifluoromethyl group, and more preferably a methyl group.

The substituent represented by $\ce{R_A^2}$ is, for example, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an amino group and an alkoxycarbonylamino group. The substituent is preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example, a straight alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group and a butyl group; and a branched alkyl group having 3 to 5 carbon atoms such as an isopropyl group, an isobutyl group and a t-butyl group. An alkyl group may have a substituent such as a hydroxyl group.

n represents the number of substituents, and is an integer of 0 or more. For example, n is preferably 0 to 4, and more preferably 0.

Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by A may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond, and the like.

In the resin (A), the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1) may be contained either alone or in a combination of two or more thereof.

Hereinafter, specific examples of the repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto.

In addition, $\ce{R_A^1}$ in the following specific examples has the same meaning as $\ce{R_A^1}$ in Formula (A-1).

**Specific example 1 (summary):** This structure shows a polymer repeating unit where $\ce{R_A^1}$ is attached to the main chain. A pendant group consists of an ester linkage ($\ce{-C(=O)O-}$) followed by a methylene group ($\ce{-CH2-}$) which connects to a 5-membered cyclic carbonate ring.

**Specific example 2 (summary):** This structure shows another polymer repeating unit with $\ce{R_A^1}$ on the main chain. A pendant group is linked via an ester ($\ce{-C(=O)O-}$) to a dimethylmethylene group ($\ce{-C(CH3)2-}$) which then connects to a 5-membered cyclic carbonate ring.
