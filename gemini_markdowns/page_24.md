![Figure S1: Effects of Fisher transformation on dynamic functional connectivity](figure-S1.png)

**Figure S1 (summary):** This figure illustrates the effects of Fisher transforming correlation coefficients on dynamic functional connectivity.
- **Panel A** shows probability density distributions of Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity (FC) magnitude for four different levels of static functional connectivity. Despite varying static connectivity magnitudes, the variances of these distributions are similar, contrasting with Figure 2 in the main text where static magnitude significantly influenced dynamic fluctuation range.
- **Panel B** displays a scatter plot of the temporal mean versus the standard deviation for the Fisher-transformed functional connectivity matrix, indicating no systematic relationship. This also contrasts with panel C in Figure 1 in the main text.

![Figure S2: Comparison of Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients](figure-S2.png)

**Figure S2 (summary):** This figure compares raw Pearson correlation coefficients with Fisher-transformed coefficients.
- **Panel A** plots Fisher Percentiles against Pearson Percentiles, showing a strong linear relationship ($r=0.9999$). This demonstrates that the monotonic nature of the Fisher transformation preserves rank, meaning percentiles remain largely unchanged. The correlation between the Fisher-transformed percentile matrix and the raw Pearson correlation coefficients' percentile matrix is approximately 1.
- **Panel B** presents a scatter plot showing the correlation of Fisher-transformed static functional connectivity with the mean Fisher-transformed dynamic functional connectivity, with an indicated correlation of $r=0.97$.
