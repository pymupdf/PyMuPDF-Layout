# A. The Hamiltonian

Let us consider the non-Hermitian FFA model defined by the following relations for the energy dispersion $E(k)$ and spectral coupling $v(k)$
$$
E(k) = -2\kappa_0 \cos k, v(k) = -\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \kappa_a \sin k
$$
(47)
where $\kappa_0, \kappa_a$ are two real-valued positive constants and $0 \leq k \leq \pi$. The Hermitian limit of this model, attained by assuming $\operatorname{Im}(E_a) = 0$, is a special case of the FFA model previously investigated in [36], which is exactly solvable (see also [29]). Note that the continuous spectrum of $H$ spans the band $(E_1, E_2)$, with $E_2 = -E_1 = 2\kappa_0$. The density of states for this model is given by
$$
\rho(E) = \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial k}\right)^{-1} = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\kappa_0^2 - E^2}} & -2\kappa_0 < E < 2\kappa_0 \\ 0 & |E| > 2\kappa_0 \end{cases}
$$
(48)
which shows van-Hove singularities at the band edges, whereas the positive spectral function $V(E)$, defined by $V(E) = \rho(E)|v(E)|^2$, reads
$$
V(E) = \begin{cases} \frac{\kappa_a^2}{\pi\kappa_0} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{E}{2\kappa_0}\right)^2} & -2\kappa_0 < E < 2\kappa_0 \\ 0 & |E| > 2\kappa_0 \end{cases}
$$
(49)
which is non-singular. Substitution of Eq. (49) into Eq. (11) yields the following expression for the self-energy $\Sigma(z)$ [46]
$$
\Sigma(z) = -i\frac{\kappa_a^2}{2\kappa_0^2} (\sqrt{4\kappa_0^2 - z^2} + iz)
$$
(50)
and thus [see Eq. (12)]
$$
\Delta(\mathcal{E}) = \operatorname{Re} (\Sigma(z = \mathcal{E} \pm i0^+)) = \begin{cases} \frac{\kappa_a^2}{2\kappa_0^2} (\mathcal{E} + \sqrt{\mathcal{E}^2 - 4\kappa_0^2}) & \mathcal{E} < -2\kappa_0 \\ 0 & -2\kappa_0 \leq \mathcal{E} \leq 2\kappa_0 \\ \frac{\kappa_a^2}{2\kappa_0^2} (\mathcal{E} - \sqrt{\mathcal{E}^2 - 4\kappa_0^2}) & \mathcal{E} > 2\kappa_0 \end{cases}
$$
(51)
The condition for the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian to possess a real-valued spectrum (i.e. to avoid complex-valued energies arising from bound states outside the continuum) is derived in Appendix B. Precisely, let $\xi_{1,2}$ be the two roots of the second-order algebraic equation
$$
\xi^2 + \frac{E_a}{\kappa_0} \xi + 1 - (\kappa_a/\kappa_0)^2 = 0
$$
(52)
Then the Hamiltonian $H$ has a real-valued energy spectrum if and only if $|\xi_{1,2}| \leq 1$. Figure 2 shows the domain in the plane $(\operatorname{Im}(E_a)/\kappa_0, \kappa_a/\kappa_0)$ where $H$ has a purely continuous energy spectrum for a few increasing values of the ratio $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0|$. The domain lies in the sector $\kappa_a/\kappa_0 \leq \sqrt{2}$ and shrinks toward $\operatorname{Im}(E_a)/\kappa_0 = \kappa_a/\kappa_0 = 0$ as $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0| \to 2^-$. For $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0| \leq 2$, bound states do exist for any value of $\kappa_a/\kappa_0$ and $\operatorname{Im}(E_a)/\kappa_0$. The wider domain is attained for $\operatorname{Re}(E_a) = 0$. In particular, for $\operatorname{Re}(E_a) = 0$ and $\kappa_a/\kappa_0 = \sqrt{2}$, from Eq. (52) it follows that $H$ has a real-valued energy spectrum provided that
$$
-2\kappa_0 < \operatorname{Im}(E_a) < 2\kappa_0
$$
(53)
Let us now consider the occurrence of spectral singularities. According to Eqs. (19) and (20) and using Eqs. (49) and (51), a spectral singularity at energy $\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E}_0$, inside the interval $(-2\kappa_0, 2\kappa_0)$, is found provided that the following two equations are simultaneously satisfied
$$
\operatorname{Im}(E_a) = \pm\frac{\kappa_a^2}{\kappa_0} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\mathcal{E}_0}{2\kappa_0}\right)^2}
$$
(54)
$$
\operatorname{Re}(E_a) = \left(1 - \frac{\kappa_a^2}{2\kappa_0^2}\right) \mathcal{E}_0
$$
(55)
For arbitrarily given values of $E_a, \kappa_a$ and $\kappa_0$, the above conditions are generally not satisfied [nowhere for $\mathcal{E}_0$ in the range $(-2\kappa_0, 2\kappa_0)$], i.e. the non-Hermitian FFA Hamiltonian is generally diagonalizable. Spectral singularities appear solely when a constraint among $\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0, \operatorname{Im}(E_a)/\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_a/\kappa_0$ is satisfied. Let us first assume $\kappa_a/\kappa_0$ strictly smaller than $\sqrt{2}$. In this case, a single spectral singularity, at the energy $\mathcal{E}_0 = $

For a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, i.e. Im(E_a) ≠ 0, in the shaded regions the energy spectrum of H is real-valued and purely continuous. Spectral singularities occur at the boundary of the shaded regions.](placeholder-figure-2.png)

**Figure 2 (summary):** This figure presents four 2D plots showing the domains of non-existence of bound states for the Hamiltonian $H$. The x-axis is $\operatorname{Im}(E_a)/\kappa_0$ and the y-axis is $\kappa_a/\kappa_0$. The subplots correspond to increasing values of $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0|$: 0, ±0.5, ±1, and ±1.8. The shaded regions, which represent where bound states do not exist and the energy spectrum is real-valued and purely continuous, are largest for $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0|=0$ (a tear-drop shape) and progressively shrink as $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0|$ increases, becoming very small and localized for $|\operatorname{Re}(E_a)/\kappa_0|=±1.8$.
