film leads to an effective 2D-like trend. Region (ii) looks however more intriguing, and requires a more accurate discussion, which can benefit from a careful comparison of the behaviour of a given quantity in regions (i) and (ii).

**Figure 7 (summary):** This plot shows the rotation angle of magnetization $\Delta\varphi_l(T)$ as a function of temperature $T$ (in K) for different surface planes ($l=1, 2, 3, 4$). Data for thickness $n=8$ (straight lines, full symbols) and $n=16$ (dashed lines, open symbols) are presented. Vertical lines mark $T_N(8)$ and $T_N(16)$. The y-axis explicitly shows $\Delta\varphi_{l,l+1}(T)$ in degrees.

For this purpose, we look at the temperature dependence of the rotation angle of the magnetization between NN planes. In Fig. 7, $\Delta\varphi_l(T)$ for $n=8$ and $n=16$ (continuous and dashed lines, respectively), is plotted for the outermost planes, $l=1 \dots 4$. For both thicknesses, a monotonic trend is observed for all $l$, but at variance with what happens for the highest thickness, for $n=8$ we see, starting from a temperature $T \le T_N(8)$, an abrupt drop of $\Delta\varphi_3$ and $\Delta\varphi_4$, which rapidly reach an almost constant value, only slightly larger than $\Delta\varphi_1$. In the temperature range $T_N(8) \le T < T_C(8)$ we thus substantially observe the same small magnetic phase shifts between all NN layers, testifying an energetically stable quasi-FM configuration giving no contribution to the helical order parameters. The latter point can be made clearer by looking at the the peak position $Q_{z,max}$ of the structure factor $S(0, 0, q_z)$. In Fig. 8 the average of $Q_{z,max}$ vs $T$ is reported, again for $n=8$ and for different lateral dimensions $L$ [@Ref26]. As expected from the previous argument, we see that $Q_{z,max} = 0$ for $T_N(8) < T < T_C(8)$, while it begins to shift to higher values as soon as the temperature decreases below $T_N(8)$, making apparent a progressive fan stabilization with $Q_{z,max} \ne 0$ and reaching a value of about $21^\circ$ for $T = 10\text{ K}$.

In a previous study, where the magnetic properties of Ho thin films were investigated by MC simulations of a Heisenberg model with easy-plane single-ion anisotropy and six out-of-plane coupling constants (as obtained by experimental neutron scattering measurements [@Ref16]) on an HCP lattice [@Ref14, @Ref15], it was found that for thicknesses comparable with the helical pitch the phase diagram landscape is quite different from what we find here. Indeed, for $n=9-16$, three different magnetic phases could be singled out, with the high-temperature, paramagnetic phase separated from the low-temperature, long-range ordered one, by an intermediate-temperature block phase where outer ordered 4-layer blocks coexist with some inner disordered ones. Moreover, it was observed that the phase transition of such inner layers turns out to have the signatures of a Kosterlitz-Thouless one.

**Figure 8 (summary):** This plot shows $Q_{z,max}$, the position of the maximum of $S(\vec{q})$, as a function of temperature $T$ (in K) for thickness $n=8$. The inset, which is not fully visible in this crop, is described as showing the magnetic vector ($m_i^x, m_i^y$) profile for some temperatures for $L=64$, with colors and symbols as in Fig. 2 (not provided in this excerpt).

The absence of the block phase in the $J_1 - J_2$ model here investigated has to be attributed to the different range of interactions, rather than to the different lattice structure. We came to this conclusion by doing some simulations using the same set of interaction constants employed in [@Ref14, @Ref15], but using a BCT lattice: the results we obtained for $\Delta\varphi_l$ with $n=12$ are reported in Fig. 9. The latter is absolutely similar to Fig. 7 of [@Ref15] and clearly displays the footmarks of the block phase (see down-triangle), with two external blocks of ordered layers ($l=1 \dots 5$ and $8 \dots 12$), where $\Delta\varphi_l$ is roughly $10^\circ$, separated by a block of disordered layers, and with almost

**Figure 9 (summary):** This plot illustrates the rotation angle $\Delta\varphi_l$ (in degrees) as a function of layer index $l$ (from 0 to 12) for a BCT lattice with $n=12$. Different lines represent various temperatures ($T=100\text{K}, 130\text{K}, 135\text{K}, 140\text{K}, 145\text{K}$). The six coupling constants set employed in [@Ref14, @Ref15] are used. The temperature range has been chosen around $T_C(n)$, and error bars lie within point size.
