# EXCEL TRAINING MANUAL

Now choose any cell in this table and choose Pivot Table wizard in the Data menu. Excel asks for the data source and suggests this table. Click OK.

**Figure 1 (summary):** This image displays a screenshot of Microsoft Excel. The "Insert" tab is selected on the ribbon, showing the "Tables" and "Illustrations" groups. The "PivotTable" option is visible, accompanied by a tooltip that reads: "Click here to summarize data using a PivotTable or to insert a PivotChart. PivotTables make it easy to arrange and summarize complicated data and drill down on details." Overlaid on the Excel worksheet is the "Create PivotTable" dialog box. Within this dialog, "Select a table or range" is chosen, with the specified range being `Sheet1!$A$2:$D$50`. For the destination of the PivotTable report, "New Worksheet" is selected. A partial view of an Excel sheet is visible in the background, showing column headers such as "Name of Worker", "Week", "Nature of Payment", and "Amount", with some sample data below them.

Here, we need to understand the data range. Excel suggests the table as shown in above Slide. If you expect to add data in the future, set the data range to include as many rows as you think you will ever need. Rather than A1:D50, you may want to specify $A$1:$D$500.

One more suggestion is, as shown in Graphic you can define the Destination of Pivot Table as New Sheet or Existing Sheet.

**Figure 2 (summary):** This image is a close-up screenshot of the "Create PivotTable" dialog box, specifically focusing on the section "Choose where you want the PivotTable report to be placed". The option "New Worksheet" is selected by default, while "Existing Worksheet" is presented as an alternative option, along with a "Location:" field (which is empty in the screenshot).
