**Continued Exemplary Repeating Units:**

This section displays a variety of polymeric repeating units, continuing from a previous page. These structures generally include (meth)acrylate and styrene-derived units with various functional groups. The examples depict:
*   (Meth)acrylate ester units featuring an ethylene-phenyl linker, where the phenyl group is substituted with a benzylic alcohol derivative, showing variations in the alkyl groups on the benzylic carbon (methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl).
*   Units where a phenyl group is directly attached to the polymer backbone, which in turn carries a substituted cyclohexyl tertiary alcohol (with or without a methoxy group on the cyclohexane).
*   (Meth)acrylate ester units linked to complex cage structures like adamantane, and other alkyl or cyclic ether-containing groups.

[0144] As the amount of the repeating unit BN2, the lower limit is preferably 5 mol %, more preferably 10 mol % based on the whole repeating units constituting the component (B). The upper limit is preferably 70 mol %, more preferably 60 mol %.

[0145] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) preferably contains the repeating unit BN2, additionally at least one kind of a repeating unit selected from the repeating units B3 to B5 in addition to the repeating unit B1 in view of coexisting high etching durability and resolution. In this case, these repeating units are contained in an amount of 60 mol % or more, more preferably 70 mol % or more, and still more preferably 80 mol % or more in the whole repeating units. This securely gives properties demanded for the inventive negative resist composition.

[0146] When the inventive resist composition is a chemically amplified negative resist composition, the component (B) may contain a lactone structure, a (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group such as a hydroxy group other than the phenolic hydroxy group, and other repeating units in order to fine-tune the properties of a resist film. Illustrative examples of the (meth)acrylate ester unit having an adhesive group include the units shown by the following general formulae (b1) to (b3). These units can be used supplementary as a unit to control the unit to give adhesiveness to a substrate and the solubility without showing acidity.

![Formula (b1)](placeholder-formula-b1.png)

**Formula (b1) (summary):** A general formula for a repeating unit derived from a (meth)acrylate, where the ester group is linked to a bicyclic lactone structure designated as G1. The $\alpha$-carbon of the (meth)acrylate unit has an $\ce{R^4}$ substituent.

![Formula (b2)](placeholder-formula-b2.png)

**Formula (b2) (summary):** A general formula for a repeating unit derived from a (meth)acrylate, where the ester group is linked to a hydroxyl-substituted adamantyl group. The adamantyl group includes a substituent designated as G2. The $\alpha$-carbon of the (meth)acrylate unit has an $\ce{R^4}$ substituent.
