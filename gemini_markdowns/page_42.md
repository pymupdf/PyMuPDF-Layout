**Figure 1 (summary):** This image depicts two main types of airspace information. The left side illustrates a *Class B Airspace* (Screened Blue with a Solid Blue Outline) for the Salt Lake City area. It highlights the Salt Lake City International (SLC) and South Valley Regional (U42) airports with their respective frequencies and altitudes, alongside a 30 NM Mode C transponder requirement boundary. The right side, labeled "Example: FAA Chart Users' Guide - IFR Enroute Symbology", shows a complex segment of an IFR enroute chart. It includes various navigation aids and waypoints (e.g., Ogden Hinckley, MOINT, EMONT, SALTA, CEDAR CITY, WASATCH), airways (e.g., V21, V32), associated altitudes, frequencies (e.g., OGD VOR, TCH VOR, FFU VOR), and restricted airspace (R-6403). It also contains a detailed text box for Class B Airspace specifics for Salt Lake City, referencing VFR Terminal Area Charts. This segment is rich with symbols representing a wide range of aeronautical navigation and regulatory information.

That airspace from the surface to 10,000' MSL (unless otherwise designated) surrounding the nation's busiest airports. Each Class B airspace area is individually tailored and consists of a surface area and two or more layers.

#### Mode C Area
*A Solid Blue Outline*

**Low Chart Only**
**Controlled Airspace**
That airspace within 30 NM of the primary airports of Class B airspace and within 10 NM of designated airports. Mode-C transponder equipment is required. (See FAR 91.215)
