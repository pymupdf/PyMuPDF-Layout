##### Reference Number 5: MEA VHF and RNAV Example

![Figure 5: Low Enroute Chart Segment showing MEA/MOCA](placeholder-figure-5.png)

**Figure 5 (summary):** This segment illustrates an enroute chart with details for airway V465, showing a path between LUNDI and OLNUE, passing through MEA GAP. It indicates various altitudes: 15000', 13300G (indicating a GPS/RNAV MEA), and an asterisked 13300' (likely MOCA). Distances of 35 and 63 nautical miles are shown along the airway, with intermediate points marked 114 and 51.

*   MEA for aircraft utilizing VHF NAVAID of 15000'
*   MEA for aircraft utilizing RNAV of 13300'
*   MOCA of 13300'

##### Reference Number 6: MCA and MTA Example at a NAVAID

![Figure 6: Jackson and Casper NAVAID details with MCA/MTA](placeholder-figure-6.png)

**Figure 6 (summary):** This section details the JACKSON NAVAID, including its frequency (122.05), VOR/DME identifier (115.4 JAC 101), and coordinates (N43°37.26' W110°43.90'). It then provides Minimum Crossing Altitude (MCA) and Minimum Turning Altitude (MTA) instructions for CASPER.

*   **MCA:**
    *   Aircraft traveling West along V520 to cross JAC at 15200'
    *   Aircraft traveling West along V330 to cross JAC at 13400'
*   **MTA (for aircraft crossing over and turning at JAC):**
    *   Aircraft traveling NE on V465 and turning to V330 on a W heading or turning to V520 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 16000' or higher.
    *   Aircraft traveling E on V520 and turning to V330 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 14200'.
    *   Aircraft traveling E on V330 and turning to V520 on a W heading must turn at altitude of 16000' or higher.
    *   Aircraft traveling NW on V328 and turning to V465 on a SW heading must turn at altitude of 15100' or higher.
