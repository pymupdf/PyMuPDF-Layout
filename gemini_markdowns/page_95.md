Santos is investing in the future of Australia's petroleum industry through the funding of the Australian School of Petroleum at the University of Adelaide.

Santos has a number of long-term projects underway which will optimise the substantial investment the Company makes in training people. Importantly, these projects will deliver programs that are targeted to meet business and individual needs and to support culture change initiatives.

across Santos operations. The long-term environmental and financial benefits of using this technology are expected to be considerable.

be working in business operations with a lean and efficient corporate and services group. With the exception of a small number of project teams, all non-award based positions in the Company were declared vacant and a selection process commenced around a set of criteria designed to ensure that people with the right skills and the ability to successfully grow Santos were appointed. As is often the case with transformational change initiatives, not everyone was re-appointed and, as a result, the workforce was reduced by 9%.

## CULTURE CHANGE

The need to develop a culture that supports the newly designed business processes was another of the major outcomes of the change program. A Santos-wide culture change program led by employees is currently underway. This long-term program is designed to ensure that the way employees work together enhances Santos' ability to be successful. One of the first tasks undertaken was a voluntary employee survey to identify the gaps between the existing culture and the desired culture. The outcomes of the survey will assist in the development of programs and activities that will better align work practices with Santos' strategic goals.

## TRAINING AND DEVELOPING PEOPLE

Making sure training and development supports current and future business requirements, and provides opportunities for people to develop their skills to achieve optimum performance, are key aspects of Santos' human resources strategy.

## BANKSIA AWARDS

Santos was selected in 2004 as a finalist in the Banksia Environmental Awards for the work undertaken in the Company-led initiative to protect the world-renowned Coongie Lakes, resulting in the area being declared a new National Park by the South Australian Government. As a finalist for this award Santos was recognised for its leadership role in bringing together a group of disparate parties to develop a Memorandum of Understanding recommending further protection for the Coongie Lakes.

## WASTE MANAGEMENT

Santos trialled innovative waste management techniques during 2004 to reduce the volume of hydrocarbon waste generated from Cooper Basin operations. Preliminary results indicate that these waste volumes can be reduced to 3-5% of their original volume, which is a significant achievement. This technology will be implemented where possible.

## REDUCED OIL SPILLS

There was a substantial reduction in the volume of hydrocarbons released to the environment in 2004, with uncontained hydrocarbons spilt reducing from 1,943 cubic metres to 83 cubic metres and Santos continues to focus on reducing oil spills.

## GREENHOUSE POLICY

Santos released its Greenhouse Policy in 2004 to drive performance improvements in this area through reducing emissions and producing oil and gas more efficiently. Santos' Greenhouse Policy is being rolled out across the organisation through cross-functional greenhouse gas teams that have the right skill sets and responsibilities to progress this initiative. These teams will manage Greenhouse Policy and regulation, carbon management and trading opportunities, and energy efficiency. A key internal driver for emissions reduction will be the promotion of energy efficiency. Santos is committed to achieving effective emission reduction targets, to the pursuit of energy efficiency strategies and to the identification and implementation.

## OIL SPILL VOLUMES

**Line Graph (summary):** This line graph, titled "OIL SPILL VOLUMES (m³)", shows the volume of oil spills over four years, from '01 to '04. The volume remained around 500 m³ in '01 and '02, then sharply increased to approximately 1700-1800 m³ in '03, identified as the "Lytton oil spill effect". By '04, the volume significantly decreased to about 100-200 m³.
