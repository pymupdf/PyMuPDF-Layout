# RADIO AIDS TO NAVIGATION

On VFR Charts, information about radio aids to navigation (NAVAID) are boxed, as illustrated. Duplication of data is avoided. When two or more radio aids in a general area have the same name with different frequencies, Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) channel numbers, or identification letters, and no misinterpretation can result, the name of the radio aid may be indicated only once within the identification box. Very High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/UHF) NAVAID names and identification boxes (shown in blue) take precedence. Only those items that differ (e.g., frequency, Morse Code) are repeated in the box in the appropriate color. The choice of separate or combined boxes is made in each case on the basis of economy of space and clear identification of the radio aids.

![NAVAID Information Box Diagram](placeholder-navaid-box.png)

**NAVAID Information Box (summary):** This diagram illustrates the components of a NAVAID information box. It shows a box containing "VORTAC PONTIAC" and an "A" in a circle. Various labels point to specific parts:
*   "Crosshatch indicates Shutdown status"
*   "Operates less than continuous or on-request" (pointing to "122.1R")
*   "FSS Radio Frequencies" ("122.1R", "123.6")
*   "NDB Frequency" ("379")
*   "Frequency Channel" ("113.8 Ch 85 PTX")
*   "Operational note" ("Rancho Murieta FSS other times.")
*   "ASOS/AWOS", "Name", "Morse Code", "Identifier"

A NAVAID that is physically located on an airport may not always be represented as a typical NAVAID symbol. A small open circle indicates the NAVAID location when collocated with an airport icon.

**VOR-SALEM Compass Rose (summary):** A circular compass rose diagram labeled "VOR-SALEM 114.3 SVM" at its center. A small open circle symbol with a star-like icon on top is shown, indicating a NAVAID located on an airport. Text next to it clarifies: "Open circle symbol shown when NAVAID located on airport. Type of NAVAID shown in top of box."

The type of NAVAID will be identified by: "VOR," (VHF Omni-Directional Range) "VORTAC" (VOR Tactical Aircraft Control), "VOR-DME," (VOR-Distance Measuring Equipment) or "DME” (Distance Measuring Equipment) positioned on and breaking the top line of the NAVAID box.

DMEs are shown without the compass rose.

# AIRPORTS

Airports in the following categories are charted as indicated (additional symbols are shown later in this Section). Public use airports:

*   (Symbol: blue four-pointed star with an inverted-U base) Hard-surfaced runways greater than 8069' or some multiple runways less than 8069'
*   (Symbol: purple X) Hard-surfaced runways 1500' to 8069'
*   (Symbol: pink outline circle) Other than hard-surfaced runways
*   (Symbol: anchor) Seaplane bases

Military airports:

*   (Symbol: concentric red circles) Other than hard-surfaced runways

Hard-surfaced runways are depicted the same as public-use airports.

U.S. military airports are identified by abbreviations such as AAF (Army Air Field), AFB (Air Force Base), MCAS (Marine Corps Air Station), NAS (Naval Air Station), NAV (Naval Air Facility), NAAS (Naval Auxiliary Air Station), etc. Canadian military airports are identified by the abbreviation DND (Department of National Defense).

Fuel Available:

*   (Symbol: purple X with surrounding tick marks) Fuel availability indicated by use of tick marks around the basic airport symbol. Consult Chart Supplement for details and availability.

Other airports with or without fuel:

*   (Symbols: pink circles with letters) H, F, U, R, (crossed-out R)
