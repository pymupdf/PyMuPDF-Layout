## Stand Alone Flight Services and Communication Outlets

### Flight Service Station (FSS)

Shadow NAVAID boxes indicate Flight Service Station (FSS) locations. Frequencies 122.2 and 255.4 (Conterminous U.S.); 121.5, 122.2, 243.0 and 255.4 (Alaska); and 121.5, 126.7, and 243.0 (Canada) are available at many FSSs and are not shown. All other frequencies are shown above the box.

Certain FSSs provide Local Airport Advisory (LAA) on 123.6.

Frequencies transmit and receive except those followed by R and T:
- R - Receive Only
- T - Transmit Only

**Figure 1 (summary):** This diagram illustrates various configurations and details for Flight Service Stations (FSS), Remote Communications Outlets (RCO), and Automated Weather Observing Systems (AWOS)/Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), categorized by "LOW CHARTS" and "HIGH CHARTS" for different operational contexts.

**Key elements depicted include:**

*   **Flight Service Station (FSS) Examples:**
    *   **Stand Alone FSS:**
        *   LOW CHARTS: DAYTON DAY (122.55)
        *   HIGH CHARTS: HARBOR HBR
    *   **Stand Alone FSS Associated with an Airport:**
        *   LOW CHARTS: MIAMI MIA (122.3), associated with Miami Exec (TMB) D*, 10 L 60, (A) 124.0.
        *   HIGH CHARTS: MIAMI MIA (122.55), associated with Miami Exec (TMB).

    *   **Stand Alone FSS within Canadian Airspace:** VICTORIA HARBOUR (122.2). FSS available 1345-0530Z.

### Remote Communications Outlet (RCO)

Thin line NAVAID boxes without frequencies and controlling FSS name indicate no FSS frequencies available. Frequencies positioned above the thin line boxes are remoted to the NAVAID sites. Other frequencies at the controlling FSS named are available, however altitude and terrain may determine their reception.

In Canada, a "D" after the frequency indicates a dial-up remote communications outlet.

**RCO Examples:**
*   **Stand Alone RCO:**
    *   LOW CHARTS: LEESBURG (122.6, 122.2)
    *   HIGH CHARTS: MONTGOMERY CO (122.4)
*   **RCO Associated/Co-located with an Airport:**
    *   LOW CHARTS: MIAMI (122.65, 122.2, 122.1R), associated with Fort Myers, Page Fld (FMY) D*, 17 L 64, (A) 123.725.
    *   HIGH CHARTS: BURLINGTON (122.4), associated with Glens Falls, Floyd Bennett Meml (G FL).

### Stand Alone AWOS & ASOS

**AWOS & ASOS Examples:**
*   BOONE AWOS-3PT (118.525 BNW)
*   STAMPEDE PASS ASOS (135.275 SMP)
