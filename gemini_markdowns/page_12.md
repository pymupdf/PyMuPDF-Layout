![Figure 5: Partition degeneracy and correlation with excursion count.](figure-5.png)

**Figure 5 (summary):** This figure investigates partition degeneracy and its correlation with excursion count using several plots.
(A) Displays a heatmap of 100 partitions identified using Louvain modularity maximization for a single instance of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) with 169 events. The y-axis shows Node Assignments and the x-axis shows Partitions identified using Louvain, with a Community ID color bar.
(B) Shows an association matrix for these 100 partitions, where each element indicates how many times two nodes were assigned to the same partition. The x and y axes represent Node ID, with an Association weight color bar.
(C) Presents a matrix of z-score Rand indices for all pairs of the 100 partitions shown in panel (A). The x and y axes represent Partitions identified using Louvain, with a Z-score Rand index color bar.
(D) Is a scatterplot showing the mean z-score Rand index for each time point plotted against the event count, both calculated for one representative participant.
(E) Is a line plot displaying the correlation coefficients between z-score Rand index and event count across participants. It notes that only four out of 80 participants exhibited negative correlations.

![Figure 6: Default mode network dissociates during mass-excursions.](figure-6.png)

**Figure 6 (summary):** This figure illustrates the dissociation of the default mode network (DMN) during mass-excursions.
(A) Shows a heatmap of the mean difference in association matrices constructed during non-mass excursions versus excursions. The x and y axes represent $A_{ij}$ (across all participants), with a color bar ranging from -0.10 to +0.10.
(B) Displays a heatmap indicating node pairs that were statistically more or less likely to be observed in the same community during non-excursions compared to excursions. The x and y axes represent nodes, with an "Excursion > Non" and "Non > Excursion" color indicator. Network labels (CONT, DMN, DAN, LIM, VAN, SMN, VIS) from Yeo et al. (2011) are used for interpretation.
(C) Is a bar chart showing the number of significant co-assignment changes for nodes (ordered by rank). This sum is derived from the rows of the matrix in panel B), identifying regions that consistently change their community co-assignments. The legend indicates various networks, and the figure highlights that regions associated with DMN predominantly show the most changes.
