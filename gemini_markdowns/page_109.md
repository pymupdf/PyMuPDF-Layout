## Abstract

There is provided a pattern forming method, including: (a) forming a film by using an electron beam-sensitive or extreme ultraviolet ray-sensitive resin composition containing a resin (A) having a repeating unit represented by Formula (1-0) and a repeating unit represented by Formula (1-2); (b) exposing the film by using an electron beam or extreme ultraviolet ray; and (c) developing the exposed film by using a developer containing an organic solvent to form a negative pattern, wherein a content of the repeating unit represented by Formula (1-0) is 45 mol % or more based on a whole repeating units in the resin (A).

## Chemical Structures

![Formula (1-0)](placeholder-formula-1-0.png)

**Formula (1-0) (summary):** This represents a repeating unit of a polymer chain, showing a backbone connected to an ester group (-COO-) which in turn is linked to a carbon atom. This carbon atom has two substituents, R1 and R2, and is further connected to another carbon with three substituents, R11, R12, and R13. The ester group is also connected via a linker L1 to the polymer backbone.

![Formula (1-2)](placeholder-formula-1-2.png)

**Formula (1-2) (summary):** This represents another repeating unit of a polymer chain. It shows a backbone connected via a linker L2 to a benzene ring. The benzene ring has $n_2$ substituents of type R3 and $n_1$ hydroxyl (OH) substituents.
