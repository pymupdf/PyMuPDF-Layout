Polyacrolein thus obtained (20 g), ethane-1,2-diol (150 g), toluene-p-sulfonic acid (1 g) and benzene (200 g) were placed in a 1000-ml round-bottomed flask, and the reaction was performed under reflux with a Dean and Stark water separator attached to the flask, until no more water was generated. After the reaction was completed, the product was precipitated from distilled water, to obtain pure compound represented by following Chemical Formula 6a (yield: 45%).

**Chemical Formula 6a (summary):** A polymer backbone with a 1,3-dioxolane group attached as a side chain, specifically derived from polyacrolein reacted with ethane-1,2-diol.

As the reaction catalyst, an acid such as trifluoromethane-sulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid or boron trifluoride-etherate may be used instead of toluene-p-sulfonic acid. As a reaction solvent, a non-carbonyl solvent such as tetrahydrofuran may be used instead of benzene.

## EXAMPLE 2

The procedure according to Example I was repeated but using propane-1,2-diol (20 g) instead of ethane-1,2-diol, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7a (yield: 45%).

**Chemical Formula 7a (summary):** A polymer backbone with a 1,3-dioxane group attached as a side chain, derived from polyacrolein reacted with propane-1,2-diol.

## EXAMPLE 3

In a 100 ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.1 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, acrylic acid (0.06 mole), tetrahydrofuran (20 g) and AIBN (0.2 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from distilled water or ethyl ether, to obtain the compound of Chemical Formula 6 (yield: 60%).

**Chemical Formula 6 (summary):** A copolymer backbone incorporating repeating units derived from 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane and acrylic acid (with the acrylic acid forming a carboxylic acid group on the polymer).

## EXAMPLE 4

The procedure according to Example 3 was repeated but using 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxane (0.1 mole) of Chemical Formula 1b instead of 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane of Chemical Formula 1a, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7 (yield: 55%).

lb instead of 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane of Chemical Formula 1a, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 7 (yield: 55%).

**Chemical Formula 1b (summary):** The monomer 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxane.

![Chemical Formula 7](chemical-formula-7.png)

**Chemical Formula 7 (summary):** A copolymer backbone incorporating repeating units derived from 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxane and an acrylic acid unit (with a carboxylic acid group).

## EXAMPLE 5

In a 250-ml flask, 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane (0.3 mole) of Chemical Formula 1a, maleic anhydride (0.1 mole), AIBN (0.8 g) and tetrahydrofuran (41 g) were placed, and the mixture was reacted at 65° C. under nitrogen or argon atmosphere for 8 hours. After the polymerization was completed, the polymers were precipitated from ethyl ether, and dried in vacuo to obtain pure compound of Chemical Formula 8 (yield: 80%).

As a polymerization initiator, conventional radical polymerization initiators such as lauryl peroxide may be used instead of AIBN (yield: 40%).

**Chemical Formula 8 (summary):** A copolymer backbone incorporating repeating units derived from 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane and maleic anhydride (forming a succinic anhydride group within the polymer backbone).

## EXAMPLE 6

The procedure according to Example 5 was repeated but using 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxane (0.3 mole) of Chemical Formula 1b instead of 2-vinyl-1,3-dioxolane of Chemical Formula 1a, to obtain the compound represented by Chemical Formula 9 (yield: 42%).
