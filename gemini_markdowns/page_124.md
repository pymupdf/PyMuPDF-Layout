## Abstract

The present invention relates to a cross-linker for use in a photoresist which is suitable for a photolithography process using KrF (248 nm), ArF (193 nm), E-beam, ion beam or EUV light source. According to the present invention, preferred cross-linkers comprise a copolymer having repeating units derived from: (i) a compound represented by following Chemical Formula 1 and/or (ii) one or more compound(s) selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and maleic anhydride.

![Chemical Formula 1: General structure of a preferred cross-linker copolymer](placeholder-chemical-formula-1.png)

**Chemical Formula 1 (summary):** A monomer unit for a copolymer cross-linker. It features a vinyl group with an $R_3$ substituent, followed by a chain containing an $R$ substituent, which is then linked to a cyclic acetal (either a 1,3-dioxolane or 1,3-dioxane derivative) with $R_1$ and $R_2$ substituents. The cyclic acetal moiety is part of a repeating unit, with 'm' representing the number of repeat units for the first part and 'n' representing the number for the cyclic acetal part.

wherein, $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R$ individually represent straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ alkyl, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ ester, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ ketone, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ carboxylic acid, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ acetal, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ alkyl including at least one hydroxyl group, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ ester including at least one hydroxyl group, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ ketone including at least one hydroxyl group, straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ carboxylic acid including at least one hydroxyl group, and straight or branched $C_{1-10}$ acetal including at least one hydroxyl group; $R_3$ represents hydrogen or methyl; $m$ represents 0 or 1; and $n$ represents a number of 1 to 5.
