## Other Components

[0317] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator, a basic compound, a surfactant, a solvent, a dye, a photo-base generator, an antioxidant, a solvent and the like. These components are described below.

### Photo-Acid Generator

[0318] The composition of the present invention may further contain a photo-acid generator in addition to the repeating unit (A) and the repeating unit (B).

[0319] The photo-acid generator is a compound capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation. The photo-acid generator which can be used may be appropriately selected, for example, from a photo-initiator for cationic photopolymerization, a photo-initiator for radical photopolymerization, a photo-decoloring agent, a photo-discoloring agent, known compounds capable of generating an acid upon irradiation with an actinic ray or radiation, which are used for microresist or the like, and a mixture thereof. Examples thereof include an onium salt such as sulfonium salt and iodonium salt, and a diazodisulfone compound such as bis(alkylsulfonyl diazomethane).

[0320] Preferred examples of the photo-acid generator include compounds represented by the following formulae (ZI), (ZII) and (ZIII):

**Figure: Chemical Structures (Summary):** This image displays a series of complex chemical structures, likely representing polymer repeating units (A and B) and specific photo-acid generator compounds (e.g., ZI, ZII, ZIII) as referred to in the patent text. The structures are presented in two columns, continuing from a previous page.

**Key types of structures shown include:**
*   **Polymer Repeating Units:** These often feature `-(CH2-CH)-` (styrenic) or `-(CH2-C(CH3))-` (methacrylic) backbones with various pendant groups. Examples include units with para-hydroxyphenyl, 2-hydroxynaphthyl, para-substituted biphenyl, or ester-linked cyclic structures (e.g., tetrahydronaphthalene or decahydronaphthalene derivatives).
*   **Photo-Acid Generator Components:** These include complex fluorinated sulfonyl imides or sulfonates, some incorporated into polymer units. A prominent example is a triarylsulfonium cation, specifically a tris(3-methoxyphenyl)sulfonium ion, which is a common type of photo-acid generator.
