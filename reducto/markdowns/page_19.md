| Axes | Horizontal: Y0 ; Vertical: Y1 |
| 45° line | Y1 = Y0 (drawn through origin) |
| Indexed line (labelled) | Y1 = ((t1 - t_w)/(t0 - t_w))·Y0 − ((t1 - t0)/(t0 - t_w))·w (slope = (t1−t_w)/(t0−t_w), intercept = −((t1−t0)/(t0−t_w))·w) |
| Second diagonal | A steeper/shallower straight line through the same intersection (unnamed) forming the other boundary of the wedge |
| Intersection | The two diagonal lines intersect in the first quadrant; this point anchors the shaded region |
| Shaded region | Yellow wedge above the intersection, bounded by the two diagonal lines (represents support under concave treatment response) |

The function ϕ can be readily shown to be nonincreasing. Thus, at the optimum Bk = (−∞, bk ) with bk+1 ≤ bk and bk ∈ [−∞, ∞] for every integer k. By Theorem 1, for δ > 0, B D k is written as

{y1 € R|³yo < bk s.t. 0 ≤ yı – Yo < and (to - tw) y1 - (t1 - tw) yo ≤ - (t₁ - to) w} BR = U{y1 € R|³yo < bk+1 S.t. Y1 - Yo≥ 8 and (to - tw) y1 - (t₁ - tw) yo ≤ - (t₁ - to) w} .

Note that Y₁ = Yo+8 and Y₁ = t₁-tw Yo to-tw to-tw t1-to wintersect at to-tw&+y-1, t₁-to t1-to ti-tw8+w. I consider w).

bk+1 ≤ bk.

The image shows three plots (a, b, c) representing Bₖᴰ for Bₖ = (-∞, bₖ) and Bₖ₊₁ = (-∞, bₖ₊₁). The plots show the relationship between Y₀ and Y₁ = Y₀ + δ, along with lines and dotted lines to indicate intervals. A vertical bar (purple in a and b, green in c) represents Bₖᴰ.

Case a) bk+1 < bk ≤ to-tw & + w t1-to

If bk+1 bk to-tw8+w, as illustrated in Figure A.5(a), for any yo <bk+1 ≤ to-tw 8+w, there exists t1-to
