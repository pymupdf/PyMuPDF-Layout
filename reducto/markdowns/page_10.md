{Bk}k=- k=-∞

where to tw+wbk+1 < bk. Consequently, the sharp upper bound is written as follows: letting FUw (w) t1-to W be the sharp upper bound on Pr (Y₁ - Yo≤ 8 W = w),

## Appendix B

Appendix B presents the procedure used to compute the sharp lower bound under MTR in Section 4 and Section 5. The following lemma is useful for reducing computational costs:

Lemma B.1 Let

{ak}=-=-∞ € arg max Σ max {F1 (ak+1) - Fo (ak), 0}, {ak}-As k=−∞ where As = {{ak}=-∞ ; 0 ≤ ak+1 - ak ≤ 8 for each integer k}.

It is innocuous to assume that {ak}=-∞ satisfies ak+2 - ak > 8 for each integer k.

Proof. I will show that for any sequence {ak}=-=-∞0 € As satisfying ak+2 - ak ≤ 8 for some integer k, one can construct {k}=-∞ € As with ãk+2 - ãk > 8 for each integer k and

∞

max {F1 (ak+1) — Fo (ak), 0} ≤ max {F1 (ak+1) - F₁ (ak), 0}.
