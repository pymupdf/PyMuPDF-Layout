FIG. 4: An ordered list of the Eigenvalues for our cluster covariance matrix.

Before we invert Cij in Eqn. 12, we note that the values of Cij are estimated to limited resolution,

2
▲Cij = (14)
√ Njk

and therefore, if Njk is small, or there are degeneracies within Cij , the inversion will be affected. This problem can be eliminated by performing a Single Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix,

Cij = U₁k DklVlj, (15)

where U and V are orthogonal matrices that span the range and the null space of Ci; and Dkɩ = X²8kɩ, a diag- onal matrix with singular values along the diagonal. In doing the SVD, we select the dominant modes to con- tribute to the x² by requiring that λ² > √2/Njk.

In Figure 4, we rank the eigenvalues (λi) for the increasing eigenmodes and see a “kink” in the distribution which we interpret as indicating a transition in the signal–to–noise of the eigenmodes, i.e., only the first ten modes contain most of the signal, while higher-ordered modes are dominated by noise. We therefore remove eigenmodes beyond this kink (with λ i < 0.01) where the eigenvalues start to flatten out.

## A. Statistical determination of large scale flow

As discussed in the Introduction, there is recent evidence for excessive bulk flow motions compared to the WMAP5-normalised ΛCDM model [18] and therefore, it is important to confirm these results as it may indicate

evidence for an alternative explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration such as modified gravity. In this paper, we provide a first demonstration of our new parameterization using clusters of galaxies from the SDSS. In detail, we attempt to model the “squashing” of the 2- D correlation function of the C4 cluster sample seen in Figure 5 using the formalism presented herein. We do however caution the reader that we expect the limited size of the DR3 sample to leads to large statistical errors, due to a significant shot–noise contribution because of their low number density. However, future cluster and galaxy samples (e.g., LRGs) should provide stronger constraints and provide a more robust test of these high bulk flow measurements in the literature.

In Figure 5, we provide the best fit parameters b and v p for the C4 correlation function presented in Figure 3 and there is as expected a clear anti-correlation between these two parameters because the anisotropic amplitude is generated by cross-correlations in the density and peculiar velocity fields. The best fit value from Figure 5 is vp = 270+433 km/s (at the 1σ level marginalised with other parameters including b) and is consistent with v p = 0. We do not quote the negative bound of the error on v p as it is below zero and thus has no physical meaning. Instead, we quote the upper bound on vp and note that our result is consistent with zero. Our measurement of vp is close to the predicted value of 203 km/s for a WMAP5–normalised ΛCDM model.

We propose above that vp is a complementary parameter for reporting such peculiar velocity measurements. The parameter gΘ, which is equivalent to fσ8, is not determined precisely without the prior information of AS . But when we report our measurement with vp , there is no uncertainty due to other cosmological parameters which are not determined accurately, as it is equivalent to g ∗ Θ determined statistically from redshift space distortion. The observed value vp at a given redshift is not only independent of bias but also independent of normalisation.

## B. Reconstruction of matter density field from vp

We convert vp measurement into gΘ using As from WMAP5 ( gΘ: coherent growth factor of peculiar velocity, and it is equivalent to fσ8 in other parameterizations). With the evolution of gΘ known, dynamics of perturbations are reconstructed to provide the history of Ψ through the Euler equation. In most theoretical models, the time variation of vp is minimal at these low redshifts discussed here for the C4 sample (z ≃ 0.1), which allows us to ignore the time-derivative part in Eq. 9. Therefore, it is straightforward to transform the coherent evolution of Θ into the coherent evolution of Ψ. If we assume no anisotropic stress, then it is easy to convert to the coherent evolution of Φ, gΦ .

We are able to determine matter density fluctuations through the Poisson equation. We calculate the coherent growth of δm, gδ = 0.7, which is related to gΦ as
