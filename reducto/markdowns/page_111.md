The repeating unit having a cyclic carbonate ester struc- 20

ture is preferably the repeating unit represented by Formula (A-1).

- Figure: Formula (A-1) — repeating unit (polymer monomer).
- Core connectivity:
  - Polymer backbone segment (left) — tertiary carbon bearing substituent R^1.
  - That backbone carbon is bonded to a carbonyl (O= C) forming an ester linkage: O=C–O–A–(cyclic carbonate).
  - A links the ester oxygen to a five‑membered cyclic carbonate (1,3‑dioxolan‑2‑one motif): a five‑membered ring with two oxygens and a carbonyl.
- Substituents/labels shown on the cyclic carbonate:
  - Z is attached to the ring (dashed curved bond indicating variable linkage).
  - (R^4)2_n indicated as a substituent associated with Z.
- Labels present on the figure: R^1, A, Z, (R^4)2_n.

Hereinafter, specific examples of the repeating unit hav- ing a cyclic carbonate ester structure are shown below, but the present invention is not limited thereto.

In addition, R in the following specific examples has the same meaning as R in Formula (A-1).

The image displays two chemical structures. Both structures contain a polymer chain with repeating units, an ester linkage, and a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one ring system. The structures differ in the substituent on the carbon adjacent to the pyranone ring. In the first structure, the carbon is unsubstituted, while in the second structure, it is substituted with a methyl group. Each polymer chain includes a substituent labeled R_A^1.

Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by Examples of the a divalent linking group represented by A may include an alkylene group, a cycloalkylene group, an ester bond, an amide bond, an ether bond, an urethane bond,
