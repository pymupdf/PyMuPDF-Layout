Notes: trajectories shown converge toward a periodic solution as time increases (red: init (0,1.2); blue: init (0,1.5)). Values are approximate, read from the plotted figure.

Figure 7: The red arcs are the trajectory of the system (5.60) with initial value (0, 1.2) and the blue arcs are the orbit with initial value (0, 1.5) . Through simulation, we observe that the trajectories approach to the periodic solution of (5.60) as time increases.

where R = 0.9 and Γ = {x|x1 = 0, x2 ≤ 0}. It is easy to see that system (5.69) is of the form (5.57) and Φ(x1 , x 2 ) = x1 = 0. The system has a periodic solution

Ψµ(t) = (1 + (1 + µ) cos(t), −(1 + µ) sin(t)) , (5.70)

where t ∈ R for µ ∈ (−2, 0]. The generating system of (5.69) has the following form

x₁ = x2,

x2 = -0.0001[x² + (x1 − 1)² − 1]x2 − x1 +1, (5.71)

and admits the periodic solution o(t) = (1+cos(t), - sin(t)). By means of the equality (V(x*), ƒ (x*)) = ((1, 0), (0, 1)) = 0 with x* = (0, 0) Є ǝr, it is easy to say that x* is a grazing point of Yo(t). Let us start with the linearization of system (5.71) around the periodic solution Yo(t). Consider a near solution y(t) = y(t, 0, y* + Ay), where Ay = (Ay1, Ay2), to the periodic solution Vo(t). Assume that y(t) satisfies condition (N1), and it meets the surface of discontinuity I at the moment t = { and at the point y = y(§, 0, y* + Ay). Considering the formula (3.10) for the transversal point y (1,2), the first дт(у) aT(y) 1 component ду can be evaluated as მყი Y2 From the last equality, the singularity is seen at the дт(у) grazing point. By taking into account (3.17) with (5.71) and მყი , we obtain that
