## 1.3.4 ENJOY POWERFUL AND IMPROVED TABLE FEATURES

Create, filter, format and expand multiple tables with a set of formulas since Microsoft excel has improved features for tables. For instance, if you want to view data in an extended table, Office Excel keeps table headers in view as you scroll.

- 1.3.5 SHARE SPREADSHEETS

Use Microsoft Excel to share multiple spreadsheets with co-workers. Other parties may also access the data online as it renders the spreadsheets as HTML. Additionally, you can navigate, filter, sort and input parameters, all within the Web browser.

Besides its numerous benefits, Microsoft Excel also has its share of shortcoming as well. Many users claim that Office Excel is not easily shared compared to other office applications.

## 2. ERROR MESSAGES (CELL REFERENCE)

If you get an error message in Excel you might not get much help from the program in finding out the cause. The articles listed here cover the cause and cures for a number of common error messages in Excel, such as #REF!, #NULL!, and #####.

2.1 INVALID CELL REFERENCE

An invalid cell reference error message occurs when a spreadsheet formula contains incorrect cell references.

- Formula bar: =#REF!+L12
- Cell (column D) displays: #REF!
- Yellow error indicator (smart tag) shown at left of the row
- Red caption in image: “#REF! error in an Excel formula”
- Implication shown: one operand in the formula was replaced by #REF! (invalid cell reference); L12 remains referenced

In above example, if you click on the cell that contains the #REF! error, you will see that the cell reference within the cell has been replaced with #REF!. Therefore, in order to fix this error, you need to re-enter the correct cell references into your formula.
