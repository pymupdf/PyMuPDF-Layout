self energy correction,

ABC-B-C+1 = (A− 1)BC+(B-1)(C-1). (A12)

It is apparent form Eq. (A12) that the leading singularity originates from the first term, (A − 1)BC ≈ A − 1 ≈ −2d( y1 − 0)(y3 − y2). Introducing new variables as in the Sec. III and integrating over x i s we obtain

We write

Here again, the integrals are divergent on the upper limit. Similarly to the previous section we differentiate it once with respect to the variable α introduced in Eq. (14) in order to isolate the leading logarithmic singularity,

The remaining integrals are easily evaluated. The subsequent integration over α restores the singularity in the

where C is an integration constant. The singular part of Eq. (A15) is given by Eq. (24).

## Appendix B: Leading singularities at the shadow mass shell, ω ∼ ky to the fourth order.

In this appendix we evaluate the singular contributions to the Green function at the shadow mass shell, ω ∼ ky to fourth order in the coupling constant. We start with the expression (A1) introduced in App. A 1. In contrast to the discussion in App. A 1 we anticipate the singularity at ω = ky to come from the region y2 ≫ x2 , and introduce new variables accordingly, x 2 = ξy2, y1 = ηy2. Performing integration over y2 we obtain

Σ (4) = i(Ja³) 4 f def dn '[(−i((w − ky) + (w − kx)§)]³–4 г(3 – 4d)n-2d(1-7)-2d 3-4d
[ | (1 – n) 2 + g2\d\n2 + हुटाव ||1 + §²|d|§|2d -1] (B1)

We notice that the singularity at ω ∼ ky comes from the region of small ξ. Therefore we keep only the first term in the square brackets in Eq. (B1). After performing remaining integrations over ξis we obtain

Σ (4) = i(Jaª)¹Ã(1 — 2d)Ã(2 – 2d) a²-2d (B2)
(-i(w - kx))3-4d

We stress that contrary to the mass shell singularities discussed in App. A, where it was important to compute the self-energy, at the shadow mass shell it is enough to consider the Green function itself.
